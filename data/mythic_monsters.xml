Renewed contact with an aboleth's mucus cloud and failing another save extends the effect for another 3 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Mucus Mist (Ex)</b> When exposed to the air, a mythic aboleth can release its mucus as a fine mist. This obscures vision like obscuring mist and has the same properties as its mucus cloud. Creatures that breathe water are able to breathe normally while within the cloud.

The creature's new "flesh" is soft and tender, reducing its Constitution score by 4 as long as the transformation persists. If the creature's flesh isn't kept moist, it dries quickly and the victim takes 1d12 points of damage every 10 minutes. Remove disease and similar effects can restore an afflicted creature to normal, but immunity to disease offers no protection from this attack. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Slime Armor (Ex)</b> A mythic aboleth can spend 1 minute to create an armorlike carapace from hardened slime.

Blink has several effects, as follows.\r\rPhysical attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn't help opponents, since you're ethereal and not merely invisible. If the attack is capable of striking ethereal creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for concealment).\r\rIf the attacker can see invisible creatures, the miss chance is also only 20%. (For an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures, there is no miss chance.) Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike.\r\rAny individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you're blinking unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. Your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane (but they might affect targets on the Ethereal Plane).\r\rWhile blinking, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane). Although you are only partially visible, you are not considered invisible and targets retain their Dexterity bonus to AC against your attacks. You do receive a +2 bonus on attack rolls made against enemies that cannot see invisible creatures.\r\rYou take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.\r\rWhile blinking, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled.\r\rSince you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures. You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones.\r\rAn ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down. As an incorporeal creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures.\r\rAn ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.\r\rForce effects and abjurations affect you normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane.

If a petrified creature fails three of these Fortitude saves in a row, the petrified state becomes permanent. A creature restored to flesh via magic has any Dexterity damage caused by cockatrice bites removed, but not any existing Dexterity damage from other sources.

Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends safely in this way if the fly spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an antimagic field.  </description></id-00001></spells> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level3> <level4> <level type="number">4</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells/> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level4> <level5> <level type="number">5</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells idcounter="2"><id-00001> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">1</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Telekinesis (at will)</name> <school type="string">transmutation</school> <level type="string">sorcerer/wizard 5, magus 5</level> <components type="string">V, S</components> <castingtime type="string">1 standard action</castingtime> <range type="string">long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)</range> <effect type="string"> or see text</effect> <duration type="string">concentration (up to 1 round/level) or instantaneous; see text</duration> <save type="string">Will negates (object) or none; see text</save> <sr type="string">yes (object); see text</sr> <shortdescription type="string">Moves object, attacks creature, or hurls object or creature.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">You move objects or creatures by concentrating on them.\r\rDepending on the version selected, the spell can provide a gentle, sustained force, perform a variety of combat maneuvers, or exert a single short, violent thrust.\r\rSustained Force: A sustained force moves an object weighing no more than 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level) up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with spell resistance.\r\rThis version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or in both directions. An object cannot be moved beyond your range. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops.\r\rAn object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require DC 15 Intelligence checks.\r\rCombat Maneuver: Alternatively, once per round, you can use telekinesis to perform a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don't provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your Combat Maneuver Bonus, and you add your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier. No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration.\r\rViolent Thrust: Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object or creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects.\r\rYou can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).\r\rYou must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects).\r\rObjects and creatures that miss their target land in a square adjacent to the target.\r\rCreatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell.\r\rIf a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).  </description></id-00001></spells> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level5> <level6> <level type="number">6</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells idcounter="4"><id-00001> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">3</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Blade Barrier</name> <school type="string">evocation[force]</school> <level type="string">cleric 6, inquisitor 6</level> <components type="string">V, S</components> <castingtime type="string">1 standard action</castingtime> <range type="string">medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</range> <effect type="string"> wall of whirling blades up to 20 ft. long/level, or a ringed wall of whirling blades with a radius of up to 5 ft. per two levels; either form is 20 ft. high</effect> <duration type="string">1 min./level</duration> <save type="string">Reflex half or Reflex negates; see text</save> <sr type="string">yes</sr> <shortdescription type="string">Wall of blades deals 1d6/level damage.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">An immobile, vertical curtain of whirling blades shaped of pure force springs into existence.

See the accompanying table for possible consequences and results of the attempt. The powers reply in a language you understand, but they resent such contact and give only brief answers to your questions. All questions are answered with "yes," "no," "maybe," "never," "irrelevant," or some other one-word answer.\r\rYou must concentrate on maintaining the spell (a standard action) in order to ask questions at the rate of one per round. A question is answered by the power during the same round. You may ask one question for every two caster levels.\r\rContact with minds far removed from your home plane increases the probability that you will incur a decrease in Intelligence and Charisma due to your brain being overwhelmed, but also increases the chance of the power knowing the answer and answering correctly. Once the Outer Planes are reached, the power of the deity contacted determines the effects. (Random results obtained from the table are subject to the personalities of individual deities.) On rare occasions, this divination may be blocked by an act of certain deities or forces.\r\rAvoid Int/Cha Decrease: You must succeed on an Intelligence check against this DC to avoid a decrease in Intelligence and Charisma. If the check fails, your Intelligence and Charisma scores each fall to 8 for the stated duration, and you become unable to cast arcane spells. If you lose Intelligence and Charisma, the effect strikes as soon as the first question is asked, and no answer is received. If a successful contact is made, roll d% to determine the type of answer you gain.\r\rTrue Answer: You get a true, one-word answer.

A creature can negate the effect on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with spell resistance.\r\rThis version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration.

You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require DC 15 Intelligence checks.\r\rCombat Maneuver: Alternatively, once per round, you can use telekinesis to perform a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don't provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your Combat Maneuver Bonus, and you add your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier.

You can hurl one object or creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects.\r\rYou can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).\r\rYou must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects).\r\rObjects and creatures that miss their target land in a square adjacent to the target.\r\rCreatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell.\r\rIf a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).  </description></id-00001></spells> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level5> <level6> <level type="number">6</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells/> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level6> <level7> <level type="number">7</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells idcounter="2"><id-00001> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">1</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Teleport, Greater (at will)</name> <school type="string">conjuration(teleportation)</school> <level type="string">sorcerer/wizard 7, summoner 5, witch 7</level> <components type="string">V</components> <castingtime type="string">1 standard action</castingtime> <range type="string">personal and touch</range> <effect type="string"> you and touched objects or other touched willing creatures</effect> <duration type="string">instantaneous</duration> <save type="string">none and Will negates (object)</save> <sr type="string">no and yes (object)</sr> <shortdescription type="string">As teleport, but no range limit and no off-target arrival.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">This spell functions like teleport, except that there is no range limit and there is no chance you arrive off target.

A wall of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Any creature adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt a Reflex save to disrupt the wall as it is being formed. A successful save indicates that the spell automatically fails.\r\rFire can melt a wall of ice, and it deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects). Suddenly melting a wall of ice creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes.\r\rIce Plane: A sheet of strong, hard ice appears. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level. It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th-level wizard can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, or any other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,000 square feet). The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides.\r\rEach 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness.\r\rCreatures can hit the wall automatically. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level.\r\rEven when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point per caster level (no save).\r\rHemisphere: The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet + 1 foot per caster level. The hemisphere is as hard to break through as the ice plane form, but it does not deal damage to those who go through a breach.  </description></id-00002></spells> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level4> <level5> <level type="number">5</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells/> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level5> <level6> <level type="number">6</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells/> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level6> <level7> <level type="number">7</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells idcounter="2"><id-00001> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">1</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Teleport, Greater (at will)</name> <school type="string">conjuration(teleportation)</school> <level type="string">sorcerer/wizard 7, summoner 5, witch 7</level> <components type="string">V</components> <castingtime type="string">1 standard action</castingtime> <range type="string">personal and touch</range> <effect type="string"> you and touched objects or other touched willing creatures</effect> <duration type="string">instantaneous</duration> <save type="string">none and Will negates (object)</save> <sr type="string">no and yes (object)</sr> <shortdescription type="string">As teleport, but no range limit and no off-target arrival.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">This spell functions like teleport, except that there is no range limit and there is no chance you arrive off target.

Using a fly spell requires only as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells normally. The subject of a fly spell can charge but not run, and it cannot carry aloft more weight than its maximum load, plus any armor it wears. The subject gains a bonus on Fly skill checks equal to 1/2 your caster level.\r\rShould the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends safely in this way if the fly spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an antimagic field.  </description></id-00001></spells> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level3> <level4> <level type="number">4</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells idcounter="3"><id-00001> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">1</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Ice Storm (at will)</name> <school type="string">evocation[cold]</school> <level type="string">druid 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, witch 4, magus 4</level> <components type="string">V, S, M/DF (dust and water)</components> <castingtime type="string">1 standard action</castingtime> <range type="string">long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)</range> <effect type="string">cylinder (20-ft. radius, 40 ft. high)</effect> <duration type="string">1 round/level</duration> <save type="string">none</save> <sr type="string">yes</sr> <shortdescription type="string">Hail deals 5d6 damage in cylinder 40 ft. across.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">Great magical hailstones pound down upon casting this spell, dealing 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 2d6 points of cold damage to every creature in the area.

A wall of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Any creature adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt a Reflex save to disrupt the wall as it is being formed. A successful save indicates that the spell automatically fails.\r\rFire can melt a wall of ice, and it deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects). Suddenly melting a wall of ice creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes.\r\rIce Plane: A sheet of strong, hard ice appears. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level. It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th-level wizard can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, or any other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,000 square feet). The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides.\r\rEach 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness.\r\rCreatures can hit the wall automatically. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level.\r\rEven when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point per caster level (no save).\r\rHemisphere: The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet + 1 foot per caster level. The hemisphere is as hard to break through as the ice plane form, but it does not deal damage to those who go through a breach.  </description></id-00002></spells> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level4> <level5> <level type="number">5</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells idcounter="3"><id-00001> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">1</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Cone of Cold (at will)</name> <school type="string">evocation[cold]</school> <level type="string">sorcerer/wizard 5, witch 6, magus 5</level> <components type="string">V, S, M (a small crystal or glass cone)</components> <castingtime type="string">1 standard action</castingtime> <range type="string">60 ft.</range> <effect type="string">cone-shaped burst</effect> <duration type="string">instantaneous</duration> <save type="string">Reflex half</save> <sr type="string">yes</sr> <shortdescription type="string">1d6/level cold damage.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">Cone of cold creates an area of extreme cold, originating at your hand and extending outward in a cone.

The noise a ghost sound spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from 16 humans, while a roaring dragon is equal to the noise from 32 humans.

A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect.\r\rYou choose to use dispel magic in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell.\r\rTargeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell's caster level). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell.\r\rFor example, a 7th-level caster casts dispel magic, targeting a creature affected by stoneskin (caster level 12th) and fly (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the stoneskin (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the fly (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the stoneskin would have been dispelled, leaving the fly intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected.\r\rYou can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a wall of fire). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect.\r\rIf you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.\r\rIf the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level (DC = 11 + the item's caster level). If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.\r\rYou automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.\r\rCounterspell: When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.  </description></id-00001> <id-00002> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">1</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Displacement</name> <school type="string">illusion(glamer)</school> <level type="string">bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, alchemist 3, summoner 3, magus 3</level> <components type="string">V, M (a small loop of leather)</components> <castingtime type="string">1 standard action</castingtime> <range type="string">touch</range> <effect type="string"> creature touched</effect> <duration type="string">1 round/level</duration> <save type="string">Will negates (harmless)</save> <sr type="string">yes (harmless)</sr> <shortdescription type="string">Attacks miss subject 50% of the time.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">The subject of this spell appears to be about 2 feet away from its true location.

(This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by a speed weapon, nor does it actually grant an extra action, so you can't use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round.) A hasted creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. Any condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.\r\rAll of the hasted creature's modes of movement (including land movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the subject's normal speed using that form of movement.

The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.\r\rTo see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the table at the end of this spell. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.\r\rFamiliarity: "Very familiar" is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. "Studied carefully" is a place you know well, either because you can currently physically see it or you've been there often. "Seen casually" is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. "Viewed once" is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic such as scrying.\r\r"False destination" is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.\r\rOn Target: You appear where you want to be.\r\rOff Target: You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is d% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly.\r\rSimilar Area: You wind up in an area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell's range, the spell simply fails instead.\r\rMishap: You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten "scrambled." You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80.\r\rEach time "Mishap" comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll.\r\r \r\r | Familiarity | On Target | Off Target | Similar Area | mishap\r\r | Very familiar | 01-97 | 98-99 | 100 | -\r\r | Studied carefully | 01-94 | 95-97 | 98-99 | 100\r\r | Seen casually | 01-88 | 89-94 | 95-98 | 99-100\r\r | Viewed once | 01-76 | 77-88 | 89-96 | 97-100\r\r | False destination | - | - | 81-92 | 93-100\r\r  </description></id-00002></spells> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level5> <level6> <level type="number">6</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells/> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level6> <level7> <level type="number">7</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells/> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level7> <level8> <level type="number">8</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells/> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level8> <level9> <level type="number">9</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells/> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level9> </levels> <parse type="number">1</parse> <points type="number">0</points> <pointsused type="number">0</pointsused> <sp type="number">0</sp> <availablelevel1 type="number">0</availablelevel1> <availablelevel2 type="number">0</availablelevel2> <availablelevel3 type="number">0</availablelevel3> <availablelevel4 type="number">0</availablelevel4> <availablelevel5 type="number">0</availablelevel5> </id-00001> </spellset> <spellmode type="string">preparation</spellmode> <spellset> <id-00002> <cc> <misc type="number">0</misc> </cc> <cl type="number">21</cl> <dc> <ability type="string">charisma</ability> </dc> <label type="string">Spell Like Abilities</label> <levels> <level0> <level type="number">0</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells/> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level0> <level1> <level type="number">1</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells idcounter="3"><id-00001> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">1</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Charm Person (at will)</name> <school type="string">enchantment(charm)[mind-affecting]</school> <level type="string">bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1, witch 1</level> <components type="string">V, S</components> <castingtime type="string">1 standard action</castingtime> <range type="string">close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</range> <effect type="string"> one humanoid creature</effect> <duration type="string">1 hour/level</duration> <save type="string">Will negates</save> <sr type="string">yes</sr> <shortdescription type="string">Makes one person your friend.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">This charm makes a humanoid creature regard you as its trusted friend and ally (treat the target's attitude as friendly).

If the condition is not met before the spell duration expires, the activity is not performed.\r\rA very reasonable suggestion causes the save to be made with a penalty (such as -1 or -2).  </description></id-00002></spells> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level3> <level4> <level type="number">4</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells idcounter="2"><id-00001> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">1</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Arcane Eye (at will)</name> <school type="string">divination(scrying)</school> <level type="string">sorcerer/wizard 4, witch 4, alchemist 4</level> <components type="string">V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)</components> <castingtime type="string">10 minutes</castingtime> <range type="string">unlimited</range> <effect type="string"> magical sensor</effect> <duration type="string">1 min./level</duration> <save type="string">none</save> <sr type="string">no</sr> <shortdescription type="string">Invisible floating eye moves 30 ft./round.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">You create an invisible magical sensor that sends you visual information.

An arcane eye travels at 30 feet per round (300 feet per minute) if viewing an area ahead as a human would (primarily looking at the floor) or 10 feet per round (100 feet per minute) if examining the ceiling and walls as well as the floor ahead. It sees exactly as you would see if you were there.\r\rThe eye can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. Solid barriers block its passage, but it can pass through a hole or space as small as 1 inch in diameter. The eye can't enter another plane of existence, even through a gate or similar magical portal.\r\rYou must concentrate to use an arcane eye.

The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.\r\r1st Round: Presence or absence of magical auras.\r\r2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.\r\r3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (arcana) skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a nonspell effect.) If the aura emanates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its properties (see Spellcraft).\r\rMagical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.\r\rAura Strength: An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.\r\r\r | Spell or Object | Aura Power \r\r | Faint | Moderate | Strong | Overwhelming \r\r | Functioning spell (spell level) | 3rd or lower | 4th-6th | 7th-9th | 10th+ (deity-level) \r\r | Magic item (caster level) | 5th or lower | 6th-11th | 12th-20th | 21st+ (artifact)\r\r Lingering Aura: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item).

Failure means it can't move that round (and must then make a Reflex save or fall), while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Acrobatics skill for details). Creatures that do not move on their turn do not need to make this check and are not considered flat-footed.\r\rThe spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item.\r\rMaterial objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while an object wielded or employed by a creature requires its bearer to make a Reflex saving throw to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made in each round that the creature attempts to pick up or use the greased item.

You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require DC 15 Intelligence checks.\r\rCombat Maneuver: Alternatively, once per round, you can use telekinesis to perform a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don't provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your Combat Maneuver Bonus, and you add your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier. No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration.\r\rViolent Thrust: Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object or creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects.\r\rYou can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).\r\rYou must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects).\r\rObjects and creatures that miss their target land in a square adjacent to the target.\r\rCreatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell.\r\rIf a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).  </description></id-00002> <id-00003> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">1</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Teleport</name> <school type="string">conjuration(teleportation)</school> <level type="string">sorcerer/wizard 5, summoner 4, witch 5, magus 5</level> <components type="string">V</components> <castingtime type="string">1 standard action</castingtime> <range type="string">personal and touch</range> <effect type="string"> you and touched objects or other touched willing creatures</effect> <duration type="string">instantaneous</duration> <save type="string">none and Will negates (object)</save> <sr type="string">no and yes (object)</sr> <shortdescription type="string">Instantly transports you as far as 100 miles per level.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster level. Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance.\r\rYou must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.\r\rTo see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the table at the end of this spell. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.\r\rFamiliarity: "Very familiar" is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. "Studied carefully" is a place you know well, either because you can currently physically see it or you've been there often. "Seen casually" is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. "Viewed once" is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic such as scrying.\r\r"False destination" is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.\r\rOn Target: You appear where you want to be.\r\rOff Target: You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is d% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly.\r\rSimilar Area: You wind up in an area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell's range, the spell simply fails instead.\r\rMishap: You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten "scrambled." You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80.\r\rEach time "Mishap" comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll.\r\r \r\r | Familiarity | On Target | Off Target | Similar Area | mishap\r\r | Very familiar | 01-97 | 98-99 | 100 | -\r\r | Studied carefully | 01-94 | 95-97 | 98-99 | 100\r\r | Seen casually | 01-88 | 89-94 | 95-98 | 99-100\r\r | Viewed once | 01-76 | 77-88 | 89-96 | 97-100\r\r | False destination | - | - | 81-92 | 93-100\r\r  </description></id-00003></spells> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level5> <level6> <level type="number">6</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells idcounter="4"><id-00001> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">1</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Dispel Magic, Greater</name> <school type="string">abjuration</school> <level type="string">bard 5, cleric 6, druid 6, sorcerer/wizard 6, witch 6, inquisitor 6, summoner 5, magus 6</level> <components type="string">V, S</components> <castingtime type="string">1 standard action</castingtime> <range type="string">medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</range> <effect type="string">20-ft.-radius burst one spellcaster, creature, or object</effect> <duration type="string">instantaneous</duration> <save type="string">none</save> <sr type="string">no</sr> <shortdescription type="string">Works as dispel magic, but can affect multiple targets.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">This spell functions like dispel magic, except that it can end more than one spell on a target and it can be used to target multiple creatures.\r\rYou choose to use greater dispel magic in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, area dispel, or a counterspell: Targeted Dispel: This functions as a targeted dispel magic, but it can dispel one spell for every four caster levels you possess, starting with the highest level spells and proceeding to lower level spells.\r\rAdditionally, greater dispel magic has a chance to dispel any effect that remove curse can remove, even if dispel magic can't dispel that effect. The DC of this check is equal to the curse's DC.\r\rArea Dispel: When greater dispel magic is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot-radius burst. Roll one dispel check and apply that check to each creature in the area, as if targeted by dispel magic. For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, apply the dispel check as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.\r\rFor each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the greater dispel magic spell, apply the dispel check to dispel the spell. For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the greater dispel magic spell, apply the dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.\r\rIf an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster) is in the area, apply the dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel one spell targeting the creature or object.\r\rYou may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.\r\rCounterspell: This functions as dispel magic, but you receive a +4 bonus on your dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.  </description></id-00001></spells> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level6> <level7> <level type="number">7</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells idcounter="4"><id-00001> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">1</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Insanity</name> <school type="string">enchantment(compulsion)[mind-affecting]</school> <level type="string">sorcerer/wizard 7, witch 7</level> <components type="string">V, S</components> <castingtime type="string">1 standard action</castingtime> <range type="string">medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</range> <effect type="string"> one living creature</effect> <duration type="string">instantaneous</duration> <save type="string">Will negates</save> <sr type="string">yes</sr> <shortdescription type="string">Subject suffers continuous confusion.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">The affected creature suffers from a continuous confusion effect, as the spell.\r\rRemove curse does not remove insanity.

Find the path works with respect to locations, not objects or creatures at a locale. The location must be on the same plane as the subject at the time of casting.

This divination is keyed to the recipient, not its companions, and its effect does not predict or allow for the actions of creatures (including guardians) who might take action to oppose the caster as he follows the path revealed by this spell.  </description></id-00001></spells> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level6> <level7> <level type="number">7</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells/> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level7> <level8> <level type="number">8</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells/> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level8> <level9> <level type="number">9</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells/> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level9> </levels> <parse type="number">1</parse> <points type="number">0</points> <pointsused type="number">0</pointsused> <sp type="number">0</sp> <availablelevel0 type="number">1</availablelevel0> <availablelevel2 type="number">1</availablelevel2> <availablelevel3 type="number">1</availablelevel3> <availablelevel4 type="number">1</availablelevel4> <availablelevel6 type="number">1</availablelevel6> </id-00002> </spellset> <xp type="number">1638400</xp> <text type="formattedtext"> <p>A ruddy glow emanates from beneath this dragon's red, gem-encrusted scales, like lava visible between cracks of cooling stone.</p> <p><b><u>Spell-Like Abilities</u></b> (CL 27th; concentration +34)</p><list><li><b>At will-</b>detect magic, find the path, pyrotechnics (DC 19), suggestion (DC 20), wall of fire</li></list> <p><b><u>Sorcerer Spells Known</u></b> (CL 17th; concentration +24)</p><list><li><b>8th (4)-</b>discern location, iron body</li><li><b>7th (7)-</b>insanity (DC 24), limited wishM, spell turning</li><li><b>6th (7)-</b>antimagic fieldM, contingencyM, greater dispel magic</li><li><b>5th (7)-</b>polymorph, telekinesis, teleport, wall of forceM</li><li><b>4th (7)-</b>fear (DC 21), fire shield, greater invisibility, stoneskinM</li><li><b>3rd (8)-</b>dispel magicM, displacement, hasteM, tongues</li><li><b>2nd (8)-</b>alter self, detect thoughts (DC 19), misdirection, resist energyM, see invisibility</li><li><b>1st (8)-</b>alarm, grease, magic missileM, shield, true strikeM M Mythic spell</li></list> <h><u>Special Abilities</u></h><p> <b>Fire Aura (Su)</b> A wyrm red dragon is surrounded by an aura of intense heat.

This ability allows it to move any fire effect in the area, as if it were the caster. This ability also allows it to reposition a stationary fire effect, although the new placement must be one allowed by the spell. Finally, for 1 round following the use of this ability, the dragon can control any new fire spell cast within its area of control, as if it were the caster. It can make all decisions allowed to the caster, including canceling the spell if it so desires. </p><p><b>Melt Stone (Su)</b> The dragon can use its breath weapon to melt rock at a range of 100 feet, affecting a 55-foot-radius area. The area becomes lava to a depth of 1 foot. Any creature in contact with the lava takes 20d6 points of fire damage on the first round, 10d6 on the second, and none thereafter as the lava hardens and cools. If used on a wall or ceiling, treat this ability as an avalanche that deals fire damage.</p> <p/><p><b>Mythic Rating</b> 10</p> <p>Few creatures inspire such dread as the magnificently wrathful red dragons, and the ones with mythic power are even more fearful. They are the embodiments of destruction, hatred, and draconic arrogance. Magnificent and utterly frightening to behold, mythic red dragons possess a fierce beauty that exceeds all other dragons. From their powerful jaws, capable of snapping iron bars and the masts of ships, to their muscular tails, which can crash through stone walls as easily as whips break skin, red dragons reflect predatory superiority and murderous perfection. A mythic red dragon's body has cordlike muscles that allow it to move more quickly and gracefully than a creature of its size should have a right to.</p> <p>Villains of the worst kind, mythic red dragons are unflinchingly evil in ways rarely matched even by other mythic evil creatures. Their destructive impulses and wrathful fiery rampages surprise and delight the most heinous demons. These legendary dragons demand annual royal sacrifices or tribute in slaves, and think nothing of working their underlings to death.</p> <p>An older mythic red dragon spends little time out of its lair, and when it does emerge it prefers to attack humanoid settlements away from the immediate vicinity, burning down buildings, dropping peasants from great heights, and demanding coins and other treasures. This raiding pattern makes it difficult for would-be dragonslayers to find the creature's actual lair.</p> <p>Mythic red dragons use their magic to protect their lairs with a variety of protective spells. A typical lair also contains slave-built mundane traps, environmental hazards such as steam vents poisonous fumes, and (if within an active volcano) molten rock as part of its defenses.</p> </text> <token type="token">tokens/Dragon, Red (Mythic Wyrm).png@mythicmonsters</token> </DragonRed-MythicWyrm> <DragonWhite-MythicJuvenile> <listlink type="windowreference"> <class>npc</class> <recordname>..</recordname> </listlink> <name type="string">Dragon, White (Mythic Juvenile)</name> <type type="string">CE Medium dragon (cold, mythic)</type> <aura type="string"/> <hd type="string">9d12+66</hd> <speed type="string">60 ft., burrow 30 ft., fly 150 ft.

The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Fire Vortex (Su)</b> A mythic fire giant can expend one use of mythic power to create a vortex of fire within 30 feet. The vortex is 5 feet wide at its base, 15 feet wide at the top, and 30 feet tall. Any creature starting its turn adjacent to the vortex takes 6d6 points of fire damage, and any creature passing through it takes 15d6 fire damage.

It must be flying downward at an angle of 45 degrees or steeper to use this ability.</p> <p/><p><b>Mythic Rating</b> 3</p> <p>A mythic griffon is a superior specimen-perhaps augmented by magic, blessed by a nature goddess, or the descendant of an exceptional line of mighty griffons dating back to the first of its kind. Stronger and faster than other griffons, it is aware of its superiority (even though it is no more intelligent than a non-mythic griffon) and will only consent to a truly heroic rider who respects it as an equal rather than as a mere steed.</p> <p>If approached by a suitable rider, a mythic griffon is no more difficult to train than a non-mythic griffon. The eggs of a mythic griffon usually sell for twice as much as those of a common griffon, though there is no way to tell if a particular hatchling is mythic until it is several weeks or months old. Mythic griffons are extremely protective of their mates, eggs, and offspring, and may spend the rest of their lives in the search for vengeance against thieves or murderers-even working with lesser beings as allies or riders.</p> <p>A mythic griffon who cannot find a suitable griffon mate may consort with unicorns, awakened horses, or mythic horses or unicorns. The offspring of such unions is usually a hippogriff, but in rare cases is a mythic hippogriff. Because of prejudice against a hippogriff's animal-level intelligence, a mythic griffon usually leaves its offspring once they are grown.</p> <p>A mythic griffon can carry up to 400 pounds as a light load, 800 pounds as a medium load, and 1,200 pounds as a heavy load.</p> </text> <token type="token">tokens/Griffon (Mythic).png@mythicmonsters</token> </Griffon-Mythic> <HellHound-Mythic> <listlink type="windowreference"> <class>npc</class> <recordname>..</recordname> </listlink> <name type="string">Hell Hound (Mythic)</name> <type type="string">LE Medium outsider (evil, extraplanar, fire, lawful, mythic)</type> <aura type="string"/> <hd type="string">5d10+20</hd> <speed type="string">40 ft.</speed> <ac type="string">17, touch 11, flat-footed 16 (+1 Dex, +6 natural)</ac> <babgrp type="string">Base Atk +5; CMB +7; CMD 18 (22 vs. trip)</babgrp> <atk type="string">bite +9 (2d6+3 plus burn)</atk> <fullatk type="string">bite +9 (2d6+3 plus burn)</fullatk> <spacereach type="string">5ft./5ft.</spacereach> <specialattacks type="string">breath weapon (10-ft. cone, 2d6 fire plus clinging flames, Reflex DC 14 half, usable every 1d4 rounds), burn (1d6, DC 14), mythic power (1/day, surge +1d6)</specialattacks> <senses type="string">darkvision 60 ft., scent; Perception +8</senses> <specialqualities type="string">DR 5/epic; Immune fire; Weaknesses vulnerability to cold</specialqualities> <skills type="string">Acrobatics +9 (+13 when jumping), Perception +8, Stealth +14, Survival +8; Racial Modifiers +5 Stealth</skills> <feats type="string">Improved Initiative, Run, Weapon Focus (bite)M</feats> <environment type="string">any (Hell)</environment> <organization type="string">solitary, pair, or pack (3-12)</organization> <treasure type="string">incidental</treasure> <alignment type="string">LE</alignment> <strength type="number">15</strength> <dexterity type="number">13</dexterity> <constitution type="number">15</constitution> <intelligence type="number">6</intelligence> <wisdom type="number">10</wisdom> <charisma type="number">6</charisma> <fortitudesave type="number">+6</fortitudesave> <reflexsave type="number">+5</reflexsave> <willsave type="number">+1</willsave> <hp type="number">47</hp> <init type="number">+5</init> <cr type="number">4</cr> <languages type="string">Infernal (can't speak)</languages> <xp type="number">1200</xp> <text type="formattedtext"> <p>This brawny hound is wreathed in flames, and its footsteps leave burning prints that sputter and smoke.</p> <h><u>Special Abilities</u></h><p> <b>Clinging Flames (Ex)</b> A creature that takes damage from a mythic hell hound's breath weapon also catches on fire (using the save DC for its burn ability).</p> <p/><p><b>Mythic Rating</b> 1</p> <p>A mythic hell hound is a prince among the wolves of Hell, feral but still subservient to the archdevils.

This fast healing applies only to damage dealt to the hydra's body. </p><p><b>Hydra Traits (Ex)</b> A mythic hydra can be killed by severing all of its heads or slaying its body. Any attack that is not an attempt to sever a head affects the body, including area attacks or attacks that cause piercing or bludgeoning damage. To sever a head, an opponent must make a sunder attempt with a slashing weapon targeting a head. A head is considered a separate weapon with hardness 0 and hit points equal to the hydra's Hit Dice. To sever a head, an opponent must deal enough damage to reduce the head's hit points to 0 or fewer. Severing a head deals damage to the hydra's body equal to the hydra's current Hit Dice. A hydra can't attack with a severed head, but takes no other penalties. </p><p><b>Regenerate Head (Ex)</b> When a mythic hydra's head is destroyed, two heads regrow in 1d4 rounds. A mythic hydra can't have more than twice its original number of heads at any one time. To prevent new heads from growing, at least 5 points of acid or fire damage must be dealt to the stump (a touch attack to hit) before they appear. Acid or fire damage from area attacks can affect stumps and the body simultaneously. A hydra doesn't die from losing heads until all its heads are cut off and the stumps are seared by acid or fire.</p> <p/><p><b>Mythic Rating</b> 3</p> <p>A mythic hydra is a deadly combination of bites, lunges, speed, and durability.

The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.\r\r1st Round: Presence or absence of magical auras.\r\r2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.\r\r3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (arcana) skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a nonspell effect.) If the aura emanates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its properties (see Spellcraft).\r\rMagical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.\r\rAura Strength: An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.\r\r\r | Spell or Object | Aura Power \r\r | Faint | Moderate | Strong | Overwhelming \r\r | Functioning spell (spell level) | 3rd or lower | 4th-6th | 7th-9th | 10th+ (deity-level) \r\r | Magic item (caster level) | 5th or lower | 6th-11th | 12th-20th | 21st+ (artifact)\r\r Lingering Aura: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power: \r\r | Original Strength | Duration of Lingering Aura \r\r | Faint | 1d6 rounds \r\r | Moderate | 1d6 minutes \r\r | Strong | 1d6x10 minutes \r\r | Overwhelming | 1d6 days\r\r Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell registers.

If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so.\r\rItems dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible.\r\rOf course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as swimming in water or stepping in a puddle). If a check is required, a stationary invisible creature has a +40 bonus on its Stealth checks. This bonus is reduced to +20 if the creature is moving. The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions. Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear.\r\rSpells such as bless that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.\r\rInvisibility can be made permanent (on objects only) with a permanency spell.  </description></id-00002></spells> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level2> <level3> <level type="number">3</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells idcounter="2"><id-00001> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">1</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Haste</name> <school type="string">transmutation</school> <level type="string">alchemist 3, bard 3, magus 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner 2</level> <components type="string">V, S, M (a shaving of licorice root)</components> <castingtime type="string">1 standard action</castingtime> <range type="string">close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</range> <effect type="string"> one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart</effect> <duration type="string">1 round/level</duration> <save type="string">Fortitude negates (harmless)</save> <sr type="string">yes (harmless)</sr> <shortdescription type="string">One creature/level moves faster, receives +1 on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">The transmuted creatures move and act more quickly than normal.

A hasted creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves.

A lamia matriarch that gains mythic power gains the mythic lamia's aura of seduction, a tail slap attack, grab, and constrict. She increases her sorcerer caster level to 8th and usually learns spells that aid her minions, such as freedom of movement and rage. She may use her touch attack to drain Wisdom or drain one use of mythic power from the target and regain one of her own uses of mythic power (save negates).</p> </text> <token type="token">tokens/Lamia (Mythic).png@mythicmonsters</token> </Lamia-Mythic> <Lich-Mythic> <listlink type="windowreference"> <class>npc</class> <recordname>..</recordname> </listlink> <name type="string">Lich (Mythic)</name> <type type="string">LE Medium undead (augmented humanoid, human, mythic)</type> <aura type="string">Aura fear (60 ft., DC 28)</aura> <hd type="string">13d8+147</hd> <speed type="string">30 ft.</speed> <ac type="string">36, touch 14, flat-footed 34 (+7 armor, +2 deflection, +2 Dex, +15 natural)</ac> <babgrp type="string">Base Atk +9; CMB +8; CMD 22</babgrp> <atk type="string">+1 heavy mace +9 (1d8) or touch +3 (1d8+6 plus paralyzing touch)</atk> <fullatk type="string">+1 heavy mace +9/+4 (1d8) and  touch +3 (1d8+6 plus paralyzing touch)</fullatk> <spacereach type="string">5ft./5ft.</spacereach> <specialattacks type="string">channel negative energy 10/day (DC 23, 7d6), hand of the acolyte (11/day), inspired spell, mythic power (7/day, surge +1d10), mythic spells 2/day, paralyzing touch (DC 28), scythe of evil (6 rounds, 2/day) Domain</specialattacks> <senses type="string">darkvision 60 ft., spell perception; Perception +29</senses> <specialqualities type="string">channel resistance +8, creeping paralysis; DR 15/bludgeoning and epic and magic; Immune cold, electricity, undead traits; SR 32; mythic phylactery, rejuvenation Combat Gear</specialqualities> <skills type="string">Heal +16, Intimidate +18, Knowledge (arcana, religion) +18, Perception +29, Sense Motive +27, Spellcraft +26, Stealth +9; Racial Modifiers +8 Perception, +8 Sense Motive, +8 Spellcraft, +8 Stealth</skills> <feats type="string">Combat Casting, Craft Wondrous Item, Extra Channel, Improved ChannelM, Improved InitiativeM, Iron Will, Mythic Spell LoreB, Spell Focus (necromancy)M, ToughnessM</feats> <environment type="string">any</environment> <organization type="string">solitary</organization> <treasure type="string">NPC gear (potions of invisibility [2], +3 chain shirt, +1 heavy mace, amulet of natural armor +3, belt of incredible dexterity +2, cloak of resistance +3, headband of mental prowess +4 [Wis, Cha], ring of protection +2, other treasure)</treasure> <alignment type="string">LE</alignment> <strength type="number">8</strength> <dexterity type="number">14</dexterity> <constitution type="number">-</constitution> <intelligence type="number">15</intelligence> <wisdom type="number">26</wisdom> <charisma type="number">20</charisma> <fortitudesave type="number">+16</fortitudesave> <reflexsave type="number">+9</reflexsave> <willsave type="number">+21</willsave> <hp type="number">209</hp> <init type="number">+13M</init> <cr type="number">17</cr> <languages type="string">Abyssal, Common</languages> <spellmode type="string">preparation</spellmode> <spellset> <id-00001> <cc> <misc type="number">0</misc> </cc> <cl type="number">13</cl> <dc> <ability type="string">wisdom</ability> </dc> <label type="string">Cleric</label> <levels> <level0> <level type="number">0</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells idcounter="6"><id-00001> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">1</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Bleed</name> <school type="string">necromancy</school> <level type="string">cleric 0, sorcerer/wizard 0, witch 0, inquisitor 0</level> <components type="string">V, S</components> <castingtime type="string">1 standard action</castingtime> <range type="string">close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</range> <effect type="string"> one living creature</effect> <duration type="string">instantaneous</duration> <save type="string">Will negates</save> <sr type="string">yes</sr> <shortdescription type="string">Cause a stabilized creature to resume dying.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">You cause a living creature that is below 0 hit points but stabilized to resume dying.

If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power: \r\r | Original Strength | Duration of Lingering Aura \r\r | Faint | 1d6 rounds \r\r | Moderate | 1d6 minutes \r\r | Strong | 1d6x10 minutes \r\r | Overwhelming | 1d6 days\r\r Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell registers.

A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect.\r\rYou choose to use dispel magic in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell.\r\rTargeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell's caster level). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell.\r\rFor example, a 7th-level caster casts dispel magic, targeting a creature affected by stoneskin (caster level 12th) and fly (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the stoneskin (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the fly (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the stoneskin would have been dispelled, leaving the fly intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected.\r\rYou can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a wall of fire). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect.\r\rIf you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.\r\rIf the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level (DC = 11 + the item's caster level). If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.\r\rYou automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.\r\rCounterspell: When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.  </description></id-00002> <id-00003> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">1</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Invisibility Purge</name> <school type="string">evocation</school> <level type="string">cleric 3, inquisitor 3</level> <components type="string">V, S</components> <castingtime type="string">1 standard action</castingtime> <range type="string">personal</range> <effect type="string"> you</effect> <duration type="string">1 min./level</duration> <save type="string"/> <sr type="string"/> <shortdescription type="string">Dispels invisibility within 5 ft./level.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">You surround yourself with a sphere of power with a radius of 5 feet per caster level that negates all forms of invisibility.\r\rAnything invisible becomes visible while in the area.  </description></id-00003> <id-00004> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">1</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Meld into Stone</name> <school type="string">transmutation[earth]</school> <level type="string">cleric 3, druid 3</level> <components type="string">V, S, DF</components> <castingtime type="string">1 standard action</castingtime> <range type="string">personal</range> <effect type="string"> you</effect> <duration type="string">10 min./level</duration> <save type="string"/> <sr type="string"/> <shortdescription type="string">You and your gear merge with stone.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">Meld into stone enables you to meld your body and possessions into a single block of stone.

Minor physical damage to the stone does not harm you, but its partial destruction (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. The stone's complete destruction expels you and slays you instantly unless you make a DC 18 Fortitude save. Even if you make your save, you still take 5d6 points of damage.\r\rAny time before the duration expires, you can step out of the stone through the surface that you entered. If the spell's duration expires or the effect is dispelled before you voluntarily exit the stone, you are violently expelled and take 5d6 points of damage.\r\rThe following spells harm you if cast upon the stone that you are occupying. Stone to flesh expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. Stone shape deals 3d6 points of damage but does not expel you. Transmute rock to mud expels you and then slays you instantly unless you make a DC 18 Fortitude save, in which case you are merely expelled.

The space within this barrier is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities.\r\rLikewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines.\r\rAn antimagic field suppresses any spell or magical effect used within, brought into, or cast into the area, but does not dispel it.\r\rTime spent within an antimagic field counts against the suppressed spell's duration.\r\rSummoned creatures of any type wink out if they enter an antimagic field. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the conjuration that is maintaining the creature. If you cast antimagic field in an area occupied by a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the creature's spell resistance to make it wink out.\r\r(The effects of instantaneous conjurations are not affected by an antimagic field because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result.) A normal creature can enter the area, as can normal missiles.\r\rFurthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals, undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures' spell-like or supernatural abilities may be temporarily nullified by the field.\r\rDispel magic does not remove the field.\r\rTwo or more antimagic fields sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as wall of force, prismatic sphere, and prismatic wall, remain unaffected by antimagic field.\r\rArtifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.\r\rShould a creature be larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, any part of it that lies outside the barrier is unaffected by the field.  </description></id-00001></spells> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level6> <level7> <level type="number">7</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells idcounter="4"><id-00001> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">1</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Blasphemy</name> <school type="string">evocation[evil, sonic]</school> <level type="string">cleric 7, inquisitor 6</level> <components type="string">V</components> <castingtime type="string">1 standard action</castingtime> <range type="string">40 ft.</range> <effect type="string">nonevil creatures in a 40-ft.-radius spread centered on you</effect> <duration type="string">instantaneous</duration> <save type="string">Will partial</save> <sr type="string">yes</sr> <shortdescription type="string">Kills, paralyzes, weakens, or dazes nonevil subjects.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">Any nonevil creature within the area of a blasphemy spell suffers the following ill effects.\r\r \r\r | HD | Effect \r\r | Equal to caster level | Dazed \r\r | Up to caster level -1 | Weakened, dazed \r\r | Up to caster level -5 | Paralyzed, weakened, dazed \r\rThe effects are cumulative and concurrent.

As an insubstantial creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures. An ethereal creature can see and hear on the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and ephemeral.

A mythic lich uses the base lich's stats and abilities except as noted here.</p> <p><b>Mythic Subtype:</b> A mythic lich gains the mythic subtype, with a rank equal to half the CR of the base lich. A mythic lich gains additional abilities depending on the base lich's CR instead of the mythic abilities it would get for having a rank. The mythic lich gains all other benefits of having the mythic subtype: ability score bonuses, bonus hit points, mythic feats, mythic power, natural armor bonus, and spell resistance increase (if any).</p> <p><b>CR:</b> Adjust the base lich's CR according to its mythic rank (this template doesn't increase the base lich's CR other than from the mythic rank). Note that a mythic lich's abilities on Table 6-1 depend on the base lich's CR, not the final CR of the mythic lich.</p> <p><b>Tier:</b> A lich with mythic tiers that becomes a mythic lich loses its tiers (and all abilities from those tiers) and gains abilities from the mythic lich template, according to the base lich's CR.</p> <p><b>Channel Resistance (Su):</b> A mythic lich's channel resistance increases to +8. At 8th tier, it increases to +12. At 10th rank, the lich becomes immune to channeled energy from non-mythic sources (except when used to heal undead).</p> <p><b>Creeping Paralysis (Su):</b> A creature that strikes a mythic lich with a natural weapon, unarmed strike, or non-reach manufactured weapon, or otherwise touches the lich must save or be affected by the lich's paralyzing touch ability. This triggers only once per round per creature.</p> <p><b>Mythic Phylactery (Su):</b> A mythic lich's phylactery can't be harmed by non-mythic sources. At 8th rank, the phylactery becomes a minor artifact, and can be destroyed by only one specific method.</p> <p><b>Mythic Potency (Su):</b> A mythic lich adds its rank to the save DCs for its fear aura and paralyzing touch abilities.</p> <p><b>Mythic Spells (Su):</b> A mythic lich gains Mythic Spell Lore as a bonus feat. The lich has a pool of magical power it can draw upon for casting mythic spells. Up to twice per day, it can use this power to cast a mythic spell without expending any uses of mythic power.</p> <p><b>Spell Resistance (Su):</b> A mythic lich gains spell resistance equal to 11 + the base lich's CR (before adding the lich's mythic rank to its SR from the mythic subtype).</p> <p><b>Augmented Spellcasting (Su):</b> At 7th rank, a mythic lich selects one of the following archmage or hierophant abilities: arcane surge, inspired spell, recalled blessing, or wild arcana. Once chosen, this selection can't be changed.</p> <p><b>Spell Perception (Su):</b> At 7th rank, a mythic lich automatically notices spellcasting within 60 feet. The lich automatically pinpoints the location of the caster, identifies the spell being cast, and knows the intended target or area of the spell.</p> <p><b>Immediate Counterspell (Su):</b> At 8th rank, a mythic lich can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to attempt to counter a spell. The lich must use a spell, spell slot, or dispel magic to counterspell as normal. This ability allows the lich to counterspell without first readying an action.</p> <p><b>Enhanced Spellcasting (Su):</b> At 9th rank, a mythic lich gains the ability to treat its 1st-level spells like cantrips or orisons. If the mythic lich is a spontaneous caster, its 1st-level spells known don't consume spell slots and can be used again. If the mythic lich prepares spells, its 1st-level spell slots aren't expended when cast and can be used again. Using metamagic feats or other abilities that alter the spell slot of a spell aren't affected by this ability (for example, a quickened magic missile uses a 5th-level spell slot and is expended when cast).</p> <p><b>Sustained by Magic (Su):</b> At 9th rank, each time a mythic lich casts a spell it regains hit points equal to three times the level of the spell slot used to cast the spell.</p> <p><b>Formidable Animation (Su):</b> At 10th rank, a mythic lich gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws. Any opponent attempting a dispel check against an effect on the lich rolls twice and uses the lower result. Anytime the lich attempts a dispel check, it rolls twice and uses the higher result.</p> <table> <tr><td colspan="5">Mythic Lich Abilities</td></tr> <tr><td>Base Lich's CR</td><td>Mythic Rank</td><td colspan="3">Mythic Abilities</td></tr> <tr><td>12-13</td><td>6th</td><td colspan="3">Channel resistance +8, creeping paralysis, mythic phylactery, mythic potency, mythic spells, spell resistance</td></tr> <tr><td>14-15</td><td>7th</td><td colspan="3">Augmented spellcasting, spell perception</td></tr> <tr><td>16-17</td><td>8th</td><td colspan="3">Channel resistance +12, immediate counterspell</td></tr> <tr><td>18-19</td><td>9th</td><td colspan="3">Enhanced spellcasting, sustained by magic</td></tr> <tr><td>20+</td><td>10th</td><td colspan="3">Channel resistance (immunity), formidable animation</td></tr></table> </text> <token type="token">tokens/Lich (Mythic).png@mythicmonsters</token> </Lich-Mythic> <Manticore-Mythic> <listlink type="windowreference"> <class>npc</class> <recordname>..</recordname> </listlink> <name type="string">Manticore (Mythic)</name> <type type="string">LE Large magical beast (mythic)</type> <aura type="string"/> <hd type="string">6d10+44</hd> <speed type="string">30 ft., fly 50 ft.

A flying creature must escape on its turn or plummet to the ground. As a swift action, a mythic manticore can expend one use of mythic power to skewer all targets hit by its spikes that turn, even if the attacks weren't critical hits. </p><p><b>Spikes (Ex)</b> With a snap of its tail, a mythic manticore can loose a volley of four spikes as a standard action (make an attack roll for each spike).

The creature can launch only 24 spikes in any 24-hour period.</p> <p/><p><b>Mythic Rating</b> 2</p> <p>A mythic manticore is a nightmarish creature, perhaps the result of crossbreeding with poisonous drakes, decadent sphinxes, or aberrant chimeras. A voracious eater, a mythic manticore may devour an entire corpse, as well as its weapons and armor, leaving nothing but a bloody stain on the ground and a few organs it finds unpalatable. Any metal bits it eats are digested and used to grow its deadly spikes. Some are known to dine on giant venomous snakes and spiders with the intent of making their poison even more powerful.</p> <p>A mythic manticore uses its thrown spikes to hold prey in place from a distance so it can leap upon it and tear it apart.

In addition, whenever the minotaur must make a saving throw while inside its lair, it can roll twice and take the higher result. A mythic minotaur can change its lair once per week.

Once created to punish to those who disobey or circumvent the orders of the gods, they use their innate magic to imprison, stalk, and consume humanoids-especially the descendants of the royal line whose blasphemy inspired the creation of this new race. Some mythic minotaurs are worshiped as demigods by primitive or fear-stricken humanoids, and accept sacrifices of young men and women to sate their hunger. They usually have custom armor and weapons appropriate for their large, inhuman frames, offered as gifts by worshipers or made by enslaved blacksmiths.</p> </text> <token type="token">tokens/Minotaur (Mythic).png@mythicmonsters</token> </Minotaur-Mythic> <Mummy-Mythic> <listlink type="windowreference"> <class>npc</class> <recordname>..</recordname> </listlink> <name type="string">Mummy (Mythic)</name> <type type="string">LE Medium undead (mythic)</type> <aura type="string">Aura despair (30 ft., paralyzed for 1d4 rounds, Will DC 16 negates)</aura> <hd type="string">8d8+56 fast healing 5</hd> <speed type="string">20 ft.</speed> <ac type="string">23, touch 10, flat-footed 23 (+13 natural)</ac> <babgrp type="string">Base Atk +6; CMB +14; CMD 24</babgrp> <atk type="string">slam +15 (1d8+12 plus mummy rot)</atk> <fullatk type="string">slam +15 (1d8+12 plus mummy rot)</fullatk> <spacereach type="string">5ft./5ft.</spacereach> <specialattacks type="string">create spawn, mythic power (3/day, surge +1d6)</specialattacks> <senses type="string">darkvision 60 ft.; Perception +16</senses> <specialqualities type="string">DR 5/-; Immune undead traits; Weaknesses vulnerability to fire; change shape (any humanoid; alter self), desert mastery</specialqualities> <skills type="string">Perception +16, Stealth +11</skills> <feats type="string">Power AttackM, Skill Focus (Perception), ToughnessM, Weapon Focus (slam)</feats> <environment type="string">any</environment> <organization type="string">solitary, warden squad (2-6), or guardian detail (7-12)</organization> <treasure type="string">standard</treasure> <alignment type="string">LE</alignment> <strength type="number">26</strength> <dexterity type="number">10</dexterity> <constitution type="number">-</constitution> <intelligence type="number">6</intelligence> <wisdom type="number">15</wisdom> <charisma type="number">15</charisma> <fortitudesave type="number">+4</fortitudesave> <reflexsave type="number">+2</reflexsave> <willsave type="number">+8</willsave> <hp type="number">92</hp> <init type="number">+0</init> <cr type="number">7</cr> <languages type="string">Common</languages> <xp type="number">3200</xp> <text type="formattedtext"> <p>This regal mummy reeks of preservative spices and wears the clothing and jewelry of a wealthy pharaoh.</p> <h><u>Special Abilities</u></h><p> <b>Create Spawn (Su)</b> As a swift action, a mythic mummy can expend one use of mythic power to transform a slain opponent into a non-mythic mummy with the advanced simple template.

The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.\r\r1st Round: Presence or absence of magical auras.\r\r2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.\r\r3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (arcana) skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a nonspell effect.) If the aura emanates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its properties (see Spellcraft).\r\rMagical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.\r\rAura Strength: An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.\r\r\r | Spell or Object | Aura Power \r\r | Faint | Moderate | Strong | Overwhelming \r\r | Functioning spell (spell level) | 3rd or lower | 4th-6th | 7th-9th | 10th+ (deity-level) \r\r | Magic item (caster level) | 5th or lower | 6th-11th | 12th-20th | 21st+ (artifact)\r\r Lingering Aura: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura).

The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.\r\r1st Round: Presence or absence of magical auras.\r\r2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.\r\r3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (arcana) skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a nonspell effect.) If the aura emanates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its properties (see Spellcraft).\r\rMagical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.\r\rAura Strength: An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.\r\r\r | Spell or Object | Aura Power \r\r | Faint | Moderate | Strong | Overwhelming \r\r | Functioning spell (spell level) | 3rd or lower | 4th-6th | 7th-9th | 10th+ (deity-level) \r\r | Magic item (caster level) | 5th or lower | 6th-11th | 12th-20th | 21st+ (artifact)\r\r Lingering Aura: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power: \r\r | Original Strength | Duration of Lingering Aura \r\r | Faint | 1d6 rounds \r\r | Moderate | 1d6 minutes \r\r | Strong | 1d6x10 minutes \r\r | Overwhelming | 1d6 days\r\r Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell registers. Each round, you can turn to detect magic in a new area.

The noise a ghost sound spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from 16 humans, while a roaring dragon is equal to the noise from 32 humans.

The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.\r\r1st Round: Presence or absence of magical auras.\r\r2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.\r\r3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (arcana) skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a nonspell effect.) If the aura emanates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its properties (see Spellcraft).\r\rMagical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.\r\rAura Strength: An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.\r\r\r | Spell or Object | Aura Power \r\r | Faint | Moderate | Strong | Overwhelming \r\r | Functioning spell (spell level) | 3rd or lower | 4th-6th | 7th-9th | 10th+ (deity-level) \r\r | Magic item (caster level) | 5th or lower | 6th-11th | 12th-20th | 21st+ (artifact)\r\r Lingering Aura: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power: \r\r | Original Strength | Duration of Lingering Aura \r\r | Faint | 1d6 rounds \r\r | Moderate | 1d6 minutes \r\r | Strong | 1d6x10 minutes \r\r | Overwhelming | 1d6 days\r\r Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell registers.

The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.\r\rDetect magic can be made permanent with a permanency spell.  </description></id-00001> <id-00002> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">1</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Read Magic (constant)</name> <school type="string">divination</school> <level type="string">bard 0, cleric 0, druid 0, paladin 1, ranger 1, sorcerer/wizard 0, summoner 0, witch 0, inquisitor 0, magus 0</level> <components type="string">V, S, F (a clear crystal or mineral prism)</components> <castingtime type="string">1 standard action</castingtime> <range type="string">personal</range> <effect type="string"> you</effect> <duration type="string">10 min./level</duration> <save type="string"/> <sr type="string"/> <shortdescription type="string">Read scrolls and spellbooks.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">You can decipher magical inscriptions on objects-books, scrolls, weapons, and the like-that would otherwise be unintelligible.

A mythic vampire uses the base vampire's stats and abilities except as noted here.</p> <p><b>Mythic Subtype:</b> A mythic vampire gains the mythic subtype, with a rank equal to half the CR of the base vampire. A mythic vampire gains additional abilities depending on the base vampire's CR instead of the mythic abilities it would get for having a rank. The mythic vampire gains all other benefits of having the mythic subtype: ability score bonuses, bonus hit points, mythic feats, mythic power, natural armor bonus, and spell resistance increase (if any).</p> <p><b>CR:</b> Adjust the base vampire's CR according to its mythic rank (this template doesn't increase the base vampire's CR other than from the mythic rank). Note that a mythic vampire's abilities on Table 6-2 depend on the base vampire's CR, not the final CR of the mythic vampire.</p> <p><b>Tier:</b> A vampire with mythic tiers that becomes a mythic vampire loses its tiers (and all abilities from those tiers) and gains abilities from the mythic vampire template, according to the base vampire's CR.</p> <p><b>Negative Energy Focus (Su):</b> A mythic vampire's energy drain ability triggers once per successful melee attack with melee weapons or natural attacks, up to a maximum of once per round for every 2 mythic ranks the vampire has.</p> <p><b>Overcome Weakness:</b> If a mythic vampire begins its turn in an area of direct sunlight, it is nauseated (rather than staggered), takes 10 points of damage, and loses its fast healing ability for that round. The vampire is still destroyed on the second round. At higher ranks, it can overcome or ignore other vampire weaknesses or aversions, as follows: garlic (4th rank), mirrors and holy symbols (6th rank), invitation (8th rank), running water (10th rank).</p> <p><b>Scabrous Claws (Su):</b> As an immediate action, a mythic vampire can expend one use of mythic power to grow claws on its hands, allowing it to make claw attacks or slam attacks. The claw attacks deal the same damage as its slams (including energy drain) plus 1d6 points of bleed damage. The claws last for 1 hour or until dismissed by the vampire as a free action.</p> <p><b>Channel Resistance (Su):</b> At 3rd rank, a mythic vampire's channel resistance increases to +8. At 6th rank, it increases to +12. At 9th rank, it increases to +16.</p> <p><b>Children of the Eclipse (Su):</b> At 4th rank, a mythic vampire can use its children of the night ability to call forth bat swarms, rat swarms, or wolves once per hour instead of once per day. Once per day, the mythic vampire can use children of the night to call forth 2d6 ghouls or 1d6+1 shadows. At 7th rank, once per day the mythic vampire can use children of the night to call forth 1d6 wraiths or mohrgs.</p> <p><b>Mist Shapes (Su):</b> At 5th rank, a mythic vampire can summon and sculpt mist into realistic shapes as the major image spell. A shape created in this way lasts for as long as the mythic vampire can see and concentrate upon it. In areas of particularly dense mist, this ability functions as mirage arcana instead of major image.</p> <p><b>Mastermind (Su):</b> At 6th rank, as a standard action a mythic vampire can see, hear, and speak through the body of a creature it has dominated. The mythic vampire can use this ability indefinitely on one creature at a time, as long as it and the creature under its control remain on the same plane. A mythic vampire using this ability can't move, but is still aware of its surroundings and can end this ability as a free action.</p> <p><b>Telekinesis (Sp):</b> At 6th rank, a mythic vampire can expend one use of mythic power to use the spell telekinesis with a caster level equal to the mythic vampire's CR.</p> <p><b>Flight (Su):</b> At 7th rank, a mythic vampire can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to gain a fly speed equal to double its base speed (perfect maneuverability) for 1 hour. When it activates this ability, the vampire chooses whether to manifest bat-like wings or to float unnaturally. If it manifests wings, it gains a bonus on Intimidate checks equal to its rank. If it chooses to float, it gains a bonus on Stealth checks equal to its rank.</p> <p><b>Create Mythic Spawn:</b> At 8th rank, a mythic vampire can expend one use of mythic power when using create spawn to cause the victim to rise as undead in 1 hour instead of 1d4 days. The mythic vampire can expend two uses of mythic power when using create spawn to create a mythic vampire instead of a vampire spawn or non-mythic vampire.</p> <p><b>Blood Omen (Su):</b> At 9th rank, a mythic vampire can expend two uses of mythic power as a standard action to drain blood from all creatures within 30 feet. Each creature must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the vampire's HD + the vampire's Cha modifier) or be affected by the vampire's blood drain ability. The mythic vampire gains the normal benefits of all blood drained in this manner.</p> <p><b>Eclipse (Su):</b> At 10th rank, a mythic vampire can expend one use of its mythic power to blot out the power of the sun in a 1-mile radius. This entire area is affected by the spell deeper darkness for 1 hour. The mythic vampire's can see through this darkness.</p> <table><tr><td colspan="5">Mythic Vampire Abilities</td></tr> <tr><td>Base Vampire's CR</td><td>Mythic Rank</td><td colspan="3">Mythic Abilities</td></tr> <tr><td>4-5</td><td>2nd</td><td colspan="3">Negative energy focus, overcome weakness (sunlight), scabrous claws</td></tr> <tr><td>6-7</td><td>3rd</td><td colspan="3">Channel resistance +8</td></tr> <tr><td>8-9</td><td>4th</td><td colspan="3">Children of the eclipse (ghouls or shadows), overcome weakness (garlic)</td></tr> <tr><td>10-11</td><td>5th</td><td colspan="3">Mist shapes</td></tr> <tr><td>12-13</td><td>6th</td><td colspan="3">Channel resistance +12, mastermind, overcome weakness (mirrors and holy symbols), telekinesis</td></tr> <tr><td>14-15</td><td>7th</td><td colspan="3">Children of the eclipse (wraiths or mohrgs), flight</td></tr> <tr><td>16-17</td><td>8th</td><td colspan="3">Create mythic spawn, overcome weakness (invitation)</td></tr> <tr><td>18-19</td><td>9th</td><td colspan="3">Blood omen, channel resistance +16</td></tr> <tr><td>20+</td><td>10th</td><td colspan="3">Eclipse, overcome weakness (running water)</td></tr></table> </text> <token type="token">tokens/Vampire (Mythic).png@mythicmonsters</token> </Vampire-Mythic> <Worg-Mythic> <listlink type="windowreference"> <class>npc</class> <recordname>..</recordname> </listlink> <name type="string">Worg (Mythic)</name> <type type="string">NE Medium magical beast (mythic)</type> <aura type="string">Aura darkness (30 ft., 1 step)</aura> <hd type="string">4d10+14</hd> <speed type="string">50 ft.</speed> <ac type="string">15, touch 12, flat-footed 13 (+2 Dex, +3 natural)</ac> <babgrp type="string">Base Atk +4; CMB +7; CMD 19 (23 vs. trip)</babgrp> <atk type="string">bite +7 (1d8+4 plus trip)</atk> <fullatk type="string">bite +7 (1d8+4 plus trip)</fullatk> <spacereach type="string">5ft./5ft.</spacereach> <specialattacks type="string">fear cone (30 ft., DC 12), mythic power (1/day, surge +1d6)</specialattacks> <senses type="string">darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision, scent; Perception +11</senses> <specialqualities type="string"/> <skills type="string">Perception +11, Stealth +9, Survival +5; Racial Modifiers +2 Perception, +2 Stealth, +2 Survival</skills> <feats type="string">Run, Skill Focus (Perception)M</feats> <environment type="string">temperate forests and plains</environment> <organization type="string">solitary, pair, or pack (3-11)</organization> <treasure type="string">incidental</treasure> <alignment type="string">NE</alignment> <strength type="number">17</strength> <dexterity type="number">15</dexterity> <constitution type="number">13</constitution> <intelligence type="number">6</intelligence> <wisdom type="number">14</wisdom> <charisma type="number">10</charisma> <fortitudesave type="number">+5</fortitudesave> <reflexsave type="number">+6</reflexsave> <willsave type="number">+3</willsave> <hp type="number">36</hp> <init type="number">+2</init> <cr type="number">3</cr> <languages type="string">Common, Goblin</languages> <xp type="number">800</xp> <text type="formattedtext"> <p>A terrifying darkness surrounds this giant wolf.</p> <h><u>Special Abilities</u></h><p> <b>Darkness Aura (Su)</b> As a free action, a mythic worg can activate its darkness aura, which reduces the light level within 30 feet of it by one step.

The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Power Lift (Ex)</b> A mythic wyvern can expend one use of mythic power to withdraw as a move action (instead of a full-round action), moving up to its speed instead of double. It can even move straight up. If it's grappling a creature, the wyvern can bring the grappled creature with it. Usually a wyvern uses this ability to carry off its prey and drop it from above onto a hard surface. Since this is a move action, the wyvern can damage its target, withdraw, and drop its target all in the same round.</p> <p/><p><b>Mythic Rating</b> 3</p> <p>A mythic wyvern has one or more true dragons in its recent ancestry, making it strong and resilient. Despite its greater power and ego, it is more inclined to accept a rider than other wyverns, perhaps because it recognizes the value of an alliance.</p> <h>Variant Mythic Wyverns</h> <p>Some mythic wyverns are closely related to one specific type of chromatic dragon. These lose their energy resistances and the power lift ability, but gain the energy immunity and breath weapon of the appropriate chromatic dragon (80 foot line or 40 foot cone, DC 17, 8d6 energy damage, 1d4 rounds).</p> </text> <token type="token">tokens/Wyvern (Mythic).png@mythicmonsters</token> </Wyvern-Mythic> </npcdata>
