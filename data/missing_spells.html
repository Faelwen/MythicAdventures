<p>You "blink" quickly back and forth between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane and look as though you're winking in and out of reality at random. <i>Blink </i>has several effects, as follows.</p>
<p>Physical attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn't help opponents, since you're ethereal and not merely <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/glossary.html#invisible">invisible</a>. If the attack is capable of striking ethereal creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for concealment).</p>
<p>If the attacker can see <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/glossary.html#invisible">invisible</a> creatures, the miss chance is also only 20%. (For an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures, there is no miss chance.) Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike.</p>
<p>Any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you're blinking unless your attacker can target <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/glossary.html#invisible">invisible</a>, ethereal creatures. Your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane (but they might affect targets on the Ethereal Plane).</p>
<p>While blinking, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane). Although you are only partially visible, you are not considered <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/glossary.html#invisible">invisible</a> and targets retain their <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/gettingStarted.html#dexterity">Dexterity</a> bonus to <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/combat.html#armor-class">AC</a> against your attacks. You do receive a +2 bonus on attack rolls made against enemies that cannot see <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/glossary.html#invisible">invisible</a> creatures.</p>
<p>You take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.</p>
<p>While blinking, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled.</p>
<p>Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures. You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones.</p>
<p>An ethereal creature is <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/glossary.html#invisible">invisible</a>, <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/glossary.html#incorporeal">incorporeal</a>, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down. As an <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/glossary.html#incorporeal">incorporeal</a> creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures.</p>
<p>An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.</p>
<p>Force effects and abjurations affect you normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane. Treat other ethereal creatures and objects as material.</p>

<p>Your unarmed strikes release blasts of energy in the form of bolts of fire or glowing red crows, which fly instantaneously to strike your target. You can make unarmed strike or flurry of blows attacks against the target as if it were in your threatened area; each successful attack deals damage as if you had hit it with your unarmed strike, except half the damage is fire and half is negative energy (this negative energy does not heal undead). For example, if you are a 14th-level monk, you can use a flurry of blows to attack five times, creating one energy crow for each successful attack against the target, and dealing 2d6 points of damage (plus appropriate unarmed strike modifiers) with each crow.</p>

<p>This spell calls the nearest wild animal of a particular type you designate (provided the animal's CR is equal to or less than your caster level) to seek you out. The animal moves toward you under its own power, so the time it takes to arrive depends on how close an animal of the desired type is when you cast the spell. If there is no animal of that type capable of reaching you within the spell's duration, you are aware of this fact, but the spell is wasted. <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/skills/knowledge.html#knowledge">Knowledge</a> of the local fauna makes this spell more effective, and the GM may permit a <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/skills/knowledge.html#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (nature) skill check (DC 15) to know what animals can be found in an area.</p>
<p>When the called animal arrives, it approaches to within 5 feet of you and remains nearby for the duration of the spell. Its starting attitude is indifferent, modified by circumstances and interaction. Other than starting attitude, this spell gives you no special influence or ability to communicate with the called animal, although you may use other spells or abilities to do so.</p>
<p>Once the spell's duration expires, the animal acts in accordance with its attitude. Most animals will likely wander off, but a hostile predatory animal may attack, especially if it is hungry or provoked.</p>
<p>Domesticated animals or animals trained by someone else, including such creatures as familiars or animal companions, are unaffected by <i>call animals</i>.</p>

The dense cloud of vermin gives you partial concealment against ranged attacks.

As a free action on your turn, you may have the swarm cling to you tightly, giving you a fly speed of 20 feet (poor maneuverability); when using the swarm to fly, it does not provide concealment or harm creatures that strike you.

<p>You can place another spell upon your person so that it comes into effect under some condition you dictate when casting <i>contingency</i>.

You must pay any costs associated with the companion spell when you cast <i>contingency.</i></p>
<p>The spell to be brought into effect by the <i>contingency </i>must be one that affects your person and be of a spell level no higher than one-third your caster level (rounded down, maximum 6th level).</p>
<p>The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. In all cases, the <i>contingency </i>immediately brings into effect the companion spell, the latter being "cast" instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur.

<p>This spell wreathes you in flame and causes damage to each creature that attacks you in melee. The flames also protect you from either cold-based or fire-based attacks, depending on if you choose cool or warm flames for your <i>fire shield</i>.</p>
<p>Any creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). This damage is either cold damage (if you choose a <i>chill shield</i>) or fire damage (if you choose a <i>warm shield</i>). If the attacker has <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/glossary.html#spell-resistance">spell resistance</a>, it applies to this effect. Creatures wielding melee weapons with reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you.</p>
<p>When casting this spell, you appear to immolate yourself, but the flames are thin and wispy, increasing the light level within 10 feet by one step, up to normal light. The color of the flames is blue or green if the <i>chill shield </i>is cast, violet or red if the <i>warm shield </i>is employed. The special powers of each version are as follows.</p>
<p><i>Chill Shield</i>: The flames are cool to the touch. You take only half damage from fire-based attacks. If such an attack allows a <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/combat.html#reflex">Reflex</a> save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful saving throw.</p>
<p><i>Warm Shield</i>: The flames are warm to the touch. You take only half damage from cold-based attacks. If such an attack allows a <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/combat.html#reflex">Reflex</a> save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful saving throw.</p>

<p>When <i>mirror image </i>is cast, 1d4 images plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images total) are created. These images remain in your space and move with you, mimicking your movements, sounds, and actions exactly. Whenever you are attacked or are the target of a spell that requires an attack roll, there is a possibility that the attack targets one of your images instead. If the attack is a hit, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. If it is a figment, the figment is destroyed. If the attack misses by 5 or less, one of your figments is destroyed by the near miss. Area spells affect you normally and do not destroy any of your figments. Spells and effects that do not require an attack roll affect you normally and do not destroy any of your figments.

<p>This spell functions like <i><a href="prismaticWall.html#prismatic-wall">prismatic wall</a>, </i>except you conjure up an immobile, opaque globe of shimmering, multicolored light that surrounds you and protects you from all forms of attack. The sphere flashes in all colors of the visible spectrum. </p>
<p>The sphere's <i>blindness </i>effect on creatures with less than 8 HD lasts 2d4 × 10 minutes.</p>
<p>You can pass into and out of the <i>prismatic sphere </i>and remain near it without harm. When you're inside it, however, the sphere blocks any attempt to project something through the sphere (including spells). Other creatures that attempt to attack you or pass through suffer the effects of each color, one at a time.</p>
<p>Typically, only the upper hemisphere of the globe exists, since you are at the center of the sphere, so the lower half is usually occluded by the floor surface you are standing on.</p>
<p>The colors of the sphere have the same effects as the colors of a <i><a href="prismaticWall.html#prismatic-wall">prismatic wall</a>.</i></p>

<p>The target's shadow becomes a flexible tether to its current square. The creature can move up to 5 feet from that square without penalty. Moving farther than 5 feet from the tether point requires the target to make a bull rush combat maneuver check against a CMB of 10 + 1/2 your caster level + your Intelligence modifier (if a witch or wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a bard or sorcerer). The target takes a -1 penalty for every 5 feet of distance between it and its tethered square. Failing this check means the target's move is wasted and it cannot move farther away. If it fails this check by 10 or more, it is pulled 5 feet toward the tether square and is knocked prone. If it beats the check by 10 or more, the spell ends. This spell does not work on creatures that do not cast shadows or reflections. If the target uses a teleportation effect or leaves the current plane, the spell ends.</p>

<p>This spell functions like <i><a href="fogCloud.html">fog cloud</a></i>, but in addition to obscuring sight, the <i>solid fog</i> is so thick that it impedes movement. Creatures moving through a <i>solid fog</i> move at half their normal speed and take a -2 penalty on all melee attack and melee damage rolls. The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like). A creature or object that falls into <i>solid fog</i> is slowed so that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes through reduces the falling damage by 1d6. A creature cannot take a 5-foot-step while in <i>solid fog</i>. <i>Solid fog</i>, and effects that work like <i>solid fog</i>, do not stack with each other in terms of slowed movement and attack penalties.</p>
<p>Unlike normal fog, only a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these vapors, and it does so in 1 round.</p>
<p><i>Solid fog </i>can be made permanent with a <i><a href="permanency.html#permanency">permanency</a> </i>spell. A permanent <i>solid fog </i>dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.</p>

<p>This spell seems to make time cease to flow for everyone but you. In fact, you speed up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen, though they are actually still moving at their normal speeds. You are free to act for 1d4+1 rounds of apparent time. Normal and magical fire, cold, gas, and the like can still harm you. While the <i>time stop </i>is in effect, other creatures are invulnerable to your attacks and spells; you cannot target such creatures with any attack or spell. A spell that affects an area and has a duration longer than the remaining duration of the <i>time stop</i> have their normal effects on other creatures once the <i>time stop </i>ends. Most spellcasters use the additional time to improve their defenses, summon allies, or flee from combat.</p>
<p>You cannot move or harm items held, carried, or worn by a creature stuck in normal time, but you can affect any item that is not in another creature's possession.</p>

<p id="true-form"><i><a href="#true-form">True form</a></i> removes any polymorph effect from a target creature, returning it to its true form, even against its will. Against creatures affected by polymorph spell effects (such as <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/spells/balefulPolymorph.html#baleful-polymorph">baleful polymorph</a></i> or <i>giant form</i>), you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect. Success means that the polymorph effect immediately ends.</p>
<p>A creature with the supernatural ability to change shape (such as a lycanthrope) must make a Will saving throw or immediately revert to its true form. If it fails this first saving throw, the creature can attempt another Will saving throw to overcome the spell as a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If this save succeeds, the spell ends and the creature is capable of changing shape once again. If the second save fails, the creature is locked in its true form for the duration of the spell, preventing any further polymorph effects from changing its shape.</p>
