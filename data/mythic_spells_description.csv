Ablative Barrier	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Add half your tier to the spell's armor bonus. Add half your tier to the amount of lethal damage from each attack that is converted to nonlethal damage and to the DR against nonlethal damage. Add half your tier to your caster level when determining how much damage the spell converts before it's discharged.</p>
Animal Aspect	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>You gain low-light vision, a +2 size bonus to the physical ability score of your choice, and a +1 enhancement bonus to your natural armor. Alternatively, you may cast the non-mythic form of this spell on a touched willing creature.</p>
Animate Dead	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Add your tier to your caster level when determining how many Hit Dice of undead you can animate with a single casting of this spell. This doesn't increase the total number of Hit Dice worth of undead you can control. By expending a second use of mythic power, you can ignore the spell's material component cost.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (6th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, any skeletons or zombies you create gain either the agile or savage mythic template. This template lasts for a number of days equal to your tier.</p><p>Alternatively, if you're 8th tier and expend 10 uses of mythic power, any skeletons you create permanently gain the mythic skeleton template.</p>
Animate Objects	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Animated objects you create with this spell get the maximum number of hit points per level, gain a +4 bonus to their Strength ability scores, and have 1-1/2 times the normal number of construction points.</p>
Animate Plants	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>As <i>animate objects</i>.</p>
Anticipate Peril	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Add your tier to the spell's initiative bonus and the maximum initiative bonus the spell can grant.</p>
Antimagic Field	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Select a number of spell schools equal to half your tier. Spells and effects of the chosen schools are unaffected by the <i>antimagic field</i>.</p>
Arboreal Hammer	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>You animate two branches instead of one, allowing the tree to attack twice per round. Add your tier to your caster level when determining the tree's Strength score. A creature struck by both slam attacks in the same round must succeed at a Fortitude save against the spell's DC or be staggered for 1 round.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (7th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the tree attempts three slam attacks per round and its slams bypass all damage reduction. A creature struck by all three slam attacks in the same round is stunned for 1 round and staggered for 1d4 rounds after the stun ends. A successful Fortitude save negates the stun and reduces the duration of being staggered by half.</p>
Arcane Cannon	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The cannon deals 6d10 points of damage on a successful hit. Add your tier to the cannon's hardness and your tier x 5 to its hit points. Its <i>conductive</i> property can channel any spell with a range of touch (you have to expend only one spell for this, not two). You may cast a spell with an energy descriptor on the cannon. If you do, for a number of rounds equal to the spell's level, half the cannon's damage is untyped damage and the other half is energy damage of the spell's type. Casting a spell with a different energy descriptor onto the cannon replaces its current energy type with that of the new spell.</p>
Baleful Polymorph	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The saving throw changes to Fortitude (partial) and Will (partial). A creature that fails the Fortitude save automatically fails the Will save. A target with the shapechanger subtype that fails its save can't use its shapechanging to shift out of its new form. A creature that succeeds at the Fortitude save is partially transformed into the intended animal. For 1 minute per level, it takes on cosmetic features appropriate to that animal and becomes one size category closer to the animal's size.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (9th)</h>: If you expend four uses of mythic power, the spell affects all other creatures with 8 Hit Dice or fewer in a 1-mile radius. Affected creatures transform into Small or smaller animals appropriate to the local environment. You can select a number of creatures up to your tier to not be affected.</p>
Bane	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The -1 penalty applies on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and all saving throws. Each affected creature must roll its next attack roll or saving throw twice and take the lower result.</p>
Barkskin	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The target also gains DR/magic equal to the double the enhancement bonus the spell provides to the target's natural armor bonus.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (6th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell grants DR/epic rather than DR/magic.</p>
Battlemind Link	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>When you cast this spell, if your linked ally uses a mythic path ability against a creature, you can use the same path ability against that creature as if you had it yourself, and your linked ally can likewise use any path abilities you use against a creature (even if that ally isn't mythic). For example, if you're a champion attacking a frost giant using the precision path ability, your linked ally can use your precision ability when she attacks that frost giant. If a path ability requires expending uses of mythic power or any other cost, your linked ally must expend that cost for you to use the ability.</p>
Battle Trance	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The number of temporary hit points you gain increases to 2d6 + your caster level (maximum +10) + your tier. The morale bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects increases to +6.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (5th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you gain a +4 morale bonus to Strength, immunity to non-mythic mind-affecting effects, and DR 5/epic.</p>
Beast Shape (all)	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Each <i>mythic beast shape</i> spell must be learned individually, and you must know the respective non-mythic <i>beast shape</i> spell to learn its mythic version. You don't have to learn them in order and are not required to know a lower-level <i>mythic beast shape</i> spell before you learn a higher-level one (for example, you can learn <i>mythic beast shape II </i>if you know <i>beast shape II</i>, even if you don't know <i>mythic beast shape I</i>). Each <i>mythic beast shape</i> spell adds the following benefits to its respective non-mythic version.</p><p>The spell's bonuses to ability scores increase by 2, the natural armor bonus increases by 1, and the ability score penalties decrease by 2 (minimum penalty of 0). Choose one natural attack type the animal form has, such as bite or claws. The critical multiplier for this attack type increases by 1 (maximum x4).</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (2nd)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the ability score bonuses increase by an additional 2. During each casting of the spell, a number of times equal to your tier, you can act as if you had the Natural Spell feat for 1 round. For example, if you're 2nd tier, you can use the Natural Spell feat for 2 rounds per casting of <i>mythic beast shape</i>.</p>
Black Mark	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Any time the cursed creature travels on or in the water more than 1 mile from shore, each day it (or the vessel it's on) is attacked by one or more aquatic or water monsters, as if summoned by <i>summon nature's ally VII</i> (caster level 13th).</p>
Black Tentacles	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Add your tier to the base attack bonus of the tentacles. The tentacles also deal an additional 2d6 points of acid damage with a successful grapple.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (6th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell creates twice as many tentacles in the same area, meaning each creature in the area is attacked twice per round. The tentacles can grapple creatures that are immune to grappling if that immunity is from a non-mythic source, but combat maneuver checks to grapple such creatures take a -5 penalty.</p>
Blade Barrier	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>You may cast this spell as an immediate action. The barrier's damage increases to 1d8 per caster level (maximum 20d8).</p><h>Mythic Augmented (3rd)</h><p>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can spend a move action to move the barrier up to 10 feet in any direction. The shape (flat or ring) and orientation (vertical or horizontal) of the wall must remain the same. If you move the barrier through a creature's space, it can attempt a saving throw to avoid the wall, as if you had created it where the creature is.</p>
Blasphemy	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>When determining the spell's effect on non-mythic creatures, add your tier to your caster level. Nonevil creatures that fail the save take a -4 penalty on attack rolls and saving throws, and their spell resistance decreases by 5 for as long as the spell's other effects last.</p>
Bless	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The +1 morale bonus applies on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and all saving throws. Once during the spell's duration, an affected creature can roll an attack roll or saving throw twice and take the higher result. The target must decide to use this ability before the first roll is attempted.</p>
Blessing of Fervor	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Affected creatures can choose two of the spell's bonuses each round rather than one.</p>
Blinding Ray	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>On a successful saving throw, the target is dazzled for 1 round. On a failed saving throw, the target is instead blinded for 1d4 rounds.</p><p>A target with light blindness, light sensitivity, or any other vulnerability to light is instead blinded for 1d4 rounds on a successful saving throw and permanently blinded on a failed saving throw.</p>
Blindness/Deafness	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>You can cause the target to be both blinded and deafened at the same time. The target must attempt a saving throw against each effect separately.</p>
Blink	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>You may spend a move action to remain corporeal or incorporeal until the end of your turn (you automatically resume blinking at the end of your turn).</p><h>Mythic Augmented (3rd)</h><p>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can spend either a swift action or a move action to remain corporeal or incorporeal until the end of your turn.</p>
Blistering Invective	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Enemies that are demoralized by your Intimidate check take 2d8 points of fire damage and catch fire (no saving throw). Any Reflex save attempted to extinguish the flames automatically fails as long as the creature remains demoralized by your Intimidate check.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (5th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell doesn't have the language-dependent descriptor and you don't take a penalty on your Intimidate check to demoralize creatures that are larger than you.</p>
Blood Crow Strike	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Unarmed strikes attempted with this spell are treated as if you had the Improved Critical (unarmed strike) feat. Use your tier plus your monk level (if any) when determining your unarmed strike damage for this spell. Fire damage from this spell bypasses fire resistance.</p>
Boiling Blood	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>A target that fails its save takes 1d3 points of fire damage per round. If a target has the orc subtype, it also gains fire resistance 5.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can affect allies as though they had the orc subtype.</p>
Break	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>You can target up to 1 Medium or smaller object per caster level.</p><h>Mythic Augmented (3rd)</h><p>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, target objects gain the broken condition on a successful save and are destroyed on a failed save. This doesn't affect mythic objects or objects held or carried by mythic creatures.</p>
Break Enchantment	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Against non-mythic effects, the spell automatically succeeds without requiring a caster level check. Against mythic effects, add your tier to your caster level check. The maximum level of spell this spell can remove is 5 + half your tier.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (7th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can apply a removed enchantment, transmutation, or curse to the creature that originally cast it. The creature must be a valid target of the spell and on the same plane as you, and it gets a saving throw at the effect's original DC.</p>
Breath of Life	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The spell heals 5d12 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25). It can revive a creature that died of hp damage within the past 2 rounds. If the target was slain by a death effect that allows a saving throw, this spell allows the creature to attempt another save against that effect. If this save is successful, the creature is revived with -10 hp plus the amount healed by this spell.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (9th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can target up to one creature per caster level within 30 feet of you. Alternatively, you can target one creature that has been dead for a number of rounds up to your caster level.</p>
Burning Gaze	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>You may focus your burning gaze on a creature or object as a move action instead of as a standard action. The target takes 1d8 points of fire damage for failing its save and for each round it's on fire.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, once during the spell's duration you can, as a full-round action, direct your burning gaze at up to one creature per caster level.</p>
Burning Hands	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The range increases to 20 feet, and the damage dealt increases to 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 5d6).</p>
Burrow	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The target can breathe underground while burrowing. If you're 3rd tier, the burrow speed increases to 20 feet through sand, soil, or gravel, and to 10 feet through stone. At 6th tier, these speeds increase to 30 feet and 15 feet respectively. At 9th tier, these speeds increase to 40 feet and 20 feet.</p><h>Mythic Augmented (3rd)</h><p>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the burrowing creature may leave behind an open tunnel with a diameter equal to half its space. When the spell's effect ends, this tunnel closes up immediately.</p>
Call Animal	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>You can call up to one animal per 2 caster levels. Animals that answer your call have a starting attitude of friendly. Add your tier to Handle Animal checks attempted to influence these animals.</p><p>You may use this spell to call magical beasts with Intelligence 1 or 2, but they can attempt Will saving throws (with a +4 bonus) to resist the spell.</p>
Call Lightning	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Each lightning bolt's damage increases to 3d10 points of damage (or 5d10 points outdoors in stormy weather). Half of this damage is electricity damage, and the other half is sonic. Creatures that succeed at their saving throws are dazzled and deafened for 1 round. Those that fail at their saving throws are dazzled and deafened for 1 minute.</p>
Cape of Wasps	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The wasp swarm fills a 15-foot-by-15-foot space centered on you (or on 1 of your squares, if your space is larger than 1 square). Creatures in the area of the swarm are affected by it normally (including the swarm's distraction ability). Add your tier to the swarm's distraction DC.</p><p>When you use the swarm to fly, it fills only your space, your fly speed is 30 feet (average maneuverability), and the swarm still provides partial concealment against ranged attacks.</p>
Chain Lightning	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>This spell deals 1d10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d10) and the save DC isn't reduced for secondary targets. Secondary targets have to be within 30 feet of any other target, not necessarily the primary target.</p>
Changestaff	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The treant-like creature created with this spell is considered a mythic creature, and it gains DR 10/epic and slashing instead of gaining DR 10/slashing.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (7th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the creature gains the savage mythic template.</p>
Chaos Hammer	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage dealt to lawful outsiders increases to 1d10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d10), and the damage dealt to other lawful creatures increases to 1d12 points of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d12). The duration of <i>slow</i> increases to 2d6 rounds. Lawful creatures that succeed at their saves are slowed for 1 round.</p>
Chill Metal	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage dealt increases to 1d8 points of cold damage on rounds 2 and 6, and to 2d8 points of cold damage on rounds 3 through 5. Each round a creature takes cold damage from this spell, it also takes 1 point of Dexterity damage (Fortitude negates).</p>
Chord of Shards	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage dealt increases to 2d8 points of piercing damage and bypasses all damage reduction. Any creature damaged by the shards takes 1d8 points of sonic damage.</p>
Circle of Death	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The number of Hit Dice worth of creatures killed by the spell increases to 1d6 per caster level (maximum 20d6). Add your tier to the maximum HD of creatures that can be affected by the spell. (For example, at 3rd tier, a creature with 12 HD cannot be affected.)</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (6th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, creatures that succeed at their saves against this spell take 1d6 points of damage per tier.</p>
Cloudkill	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>As a move action, you can move the cloud 10 feet in any direction. Add your tier to the spell's level and Hit Dice categories to determine its effect on creatures. (For example, at 3rd tier a creature with 6 or fewer HD gets no save, one with 7-9 HD must save or die, and one with 10 or more HD must save or take 1d4 points of Con damage.)<span></span></p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (6th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell bypasses the poison immunity of living creatures.</p>
Color Spray	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The range increases to 30 feet. Add half your tier to the spell's Hit Dice categories to determine its effects on creatures. (At 3rd tier a creature with 3 or fewer HD is unconscious, blinded, and stunned; one with 4 or 5 HD is blinded and stunned, and one with 6 or more HD is stunned.) Creatures that succeed at their saves are dazzled for 1 minute.</p>
Command	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>You can target up to one creature per level, each of which must receive the same command. Creatures that succeed at their saving throws are staggered for 1 round (this is a mind-affecting effect).</p>
Companion Mind Link	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Your animal companion understands complex instructions transmitted by the spell. It can perform any trick (even one it doesn't know) as well as any activity that could be understood by a creature with an Intelligence score of 8.</p>
Cone of Cold	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage dealt increases to 1d10 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d10). Any creature that fails its save is partially encased in ice, reducing its speed by half. Creatures with the cold or incorporeal subtype or immunity to being grappled are immune to this effect. The reduced movement lasts until the ice is destroyed. Destroying the ice requires a successful Strength or dispel check against the spell's DC, or dealing bludgeoning or fire damage equal to 1 point per caster level to the creature.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented</h>: You can expend two uses of mythic power to transform the spell's cold into a barrage of giant hailstones, icicles, or shards. Half the spell's damage is your choice of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, and the other half is cold damage.</p>
Confusion	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Roll on the table below instead of the non-mythic version at the start of each subject's turn to see what it does in that round.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power when casting the spell, you force one affected creature per round to roll on the table twice and take the higher result.</p>
Conjure Black Pudding	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The black pudding has fast healing equal to your tier, as do any puddings that split off from it. The black puddings from this spell never attack you, though they're otherwise uncontrolled and might attack your allies if there are no other obvious opponents.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (6th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the pudding gains the savage mythic template (see page 224). Puddings that split off from the giant pudding don't gain the template.</p>
Consecrate	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Select one alignment component that you have (chaotic, good, or lawful). The spell's penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saves also affects outsiders with the opposite alignment subtype as if they were undead.</p>
Contagion	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The affected target is highly contagious. Any creature it touches or that touches it with natural weapons or unarmed strikes must save or contract the disease. The save DC for these targets is equal to the spell's DC - 4. The target can't spread this disease to you.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (7th)</h>: If you expend five uses of mythic power, the spell targets every living creature within a 1-mile radius. You can select one creature per caster level within your line of sight; these creatures are unaffected by the spell.</p>
Contingency	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>You can cast this spell on yourself or another willing creature as if the spell had a range of touch. A companion spell placed on another creature must be a spell from you, not from the creature, and affects that creature when triggered. The target can have only one <i>contingency</i> spell upon it at a time unless it also knows <i>mythic contingency</i>. The number of companion spells you can have on yourself is equal to 1 + half your tier.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (5th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the casting time changes to 1 full round plus the casting time of the companion spell, but the duration of <i>mythic contingency</i> decreases to 1 hour per level or until discharged.</p>
Control Weather	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The casting time changes to 1 standard action, and the duration doubles. The weather changes after a number of rounds equal to 11 - your tier.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (6th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can create weather of any type regardless of the season, and the weather changes after 1 round.</p>
Cup of Dust	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>On a failed save, the target immediately takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per tier. Add your tier to the DC of any further Constitution checks the target attempts to resist dehydration as part of this spell's effects. While the curse is in effect, the target gains no benefit from any spell, effect, or item that requires drinking, such as potions and elixirs (though these are still used up when the target drinks them).</p>
Cure Critical Wounds	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage cured increases to 8d8 points of damage + 2 points per caster level (maximum +40). The spell cures up to 4 points of ability damage if the target is a living creature. The target chooses what types of ability damage are cured.</p>
Cure Light Wounds	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage cured increases to 2d8 points of damage + 2 points per caster level (maximum +10). The spell cures up to 1 point of ability damage if the target is a living creature. The target chooses what type of ability damage is cured.</p>
Cure Moderate Wounds	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage cured increases to 4d8 points of damage + 2 points per caster level (maximum +20). The spell cures up to 2 points of ability damage if the target is a living creature. The target chooses what types of ability damage are cured.</p>
Cure Serious Wounds	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage cured increases to 6d8 points of damage + 2 points per caster level (maximum +30). The spell cures up to 3 points of ability damage if the target is a living creature. The target chooses what types of ability damage are cured.</p>
Damnation Stride	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The burst of fire created reeks of sulfur and brimstone and also acts like <i>stinking cloud</i> (with the same duration as that spell and a separate Fortitude save).</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (6th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you bring one unwilling adjacent creature with you. You may bring additional creatures, but each must be adjacent to you and each requires you to expend one additional use of mythic power. These creatures must first attempt a saving throw against the burst of flame and <i>stinking cloud</i>, then can attempt a Will saving throw to resist being teleported with you.</p>
Darkness	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The illumination level in the area drops to darkness regardless of the existing lighting conditions. Non-mythic spells and effects can't increase the light level in the area. Creatures with darkvision and the power to see in darkness have difficulty seeing through this darkness, and can see as well as a human can in dim light. Creatures in the area of darkness take a -2 penalty on saves against fear.</p>
Daybreak Arrow	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The additional damage to undead and creatures harmed by sunlight increases to 1d8. The affected ammunition is entirely composed of radiant energy, and bypasses all damage resistance from undead targets and those harmed by sunlight. The duration of the sunrod light effect increases to 1 minute.</p>
Daylight	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The illumination in the additional 60 foot radius increases to at least normal light regardless of the existing lighting conditions. Creatures that take penalties in bright light double those penalties while in the area of bright light produced by this spell. All other creatures in the area of bright light gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Perception checks and saves to resist fear.</p>
Death Knell	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Increase the spell's range to close (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels). Increase the temporary hp gained from the spell to 2d8 and the enhancement bonuses to Strength to +4, and gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Dexterity.</p><h>Mythic Augmented (3rd)</h><p>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the casting time decreases to 1 immediate action, and you may target a creature that you killed on your last turn as if it were still alive; the dead target gets no save.</p>
Deep Slumber	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>This spell works like <i>mythic sleep</i>, except that it affects up to 20 Hit Dice of creatures. Alternatively, you may target one creature rather than an area, increasing the duration to 1 hour per level.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (5th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, creatures affected by the spell can be awakened only by mythic effects. If you're 5th tier and expend three uses of mythic power, the duration increases to 10 years per tier. If you're 5th tier and expend four uses of mythic power, the spell has both augmented effects. Creatures sleeping for years because of this spell age and breathe as normal, but don't need to eat or drink while the spell lasts.</p>
Defile Armor	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>You gain DR 5/good while wearing the target armor. While using your judgment or smite ability, this improves to DR 10/good.</p><h>Mythic Augmented (3rd)</h><p>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, while you use your judgment or smite, add half your tier to your AC as a profane bonus.</p>
Desecrate	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Select one alignment component that you have (chaotic, evil, or lawful). Outsiders with the opposite alignment subtype of the chosen alignment component take a -1 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saves in the area.</p>
Detect Scrying	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>This spell automatically gives you a visual image of the creature scrying you. If it's using a non-mythic means of scrying, you also gain an accurate sense of its direction and distance from you. You automatically succeed at caster level checks to overcome <i>nondetection</i> or similar effects (other than <i>mind blank</i>) that block your ability to detect the creature.</p><p>If you learn the creature's direction and distance with this spell, you can, as an immediate action, cast a mind-affecting spell through the scrying sensor to target the creature. This spell affects only the scrying creature, even if the spell normally affects an area or multiple targets. You must expend a number of uses of mythic power equal to the level of the spell you wish to cast against the creature.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (6th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, even <i>mind blank</i> doesn't prevent you from detecting the scrying creature. If you teleport to the creature's location within 1 minute, you arrive on target (with no chance of error) and bypass non-mythic effects that block teleportation. Alternatively, you can compel the creature to attempt to teleport to you within 1 minute (Will negates, DC equal to 10 plus double your tier). It must use its own means of teleportation to do so, but you guarantee it arrives on target and bypasses non-mythic effects that block teleportation to your location.</p>
Devolution	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The saving throw changes to Will (partial). If it succeeds at its save, the eidolon loses one evolution, chosen at random.</p>
Dictum	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>When determining the spell's effect on non-mythic creatures, add your tier to your caster level. Nonlawful creatures that fail their saves against the spell also take a -4 penalty on attack rolls and saving throws, and their spell resistance decreases by 5 for as long as the spell's other effects last.</p>
Dimensional Lock	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The spell doesn't interfere with your extradimensional travel spells and effects.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (4th)</h>: You can augment <i>mythic dimensional lock</i> to redirect teleporting creatures to another location. If you expend two uses of mythic power, designate a location that you're very familiar with. This location must be on the same plane as you. Any creature attempting to use extradimensional travel from outside the spell's area into that area is instead redirected to this other location.</p><p>The creature can attempt a Spellcraft check against your caster level. If it succeeds, it's aware of the redirection (though not the destination) and can interrupt its spellcasting, losing the spell but not teleporting.</p>
Dimension Door	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The duration of this spell changes to 1 round per 2 caster levels, and it creates a temporary, invisible, one-way portal in your square to your destination. You immediately pass through the portal and arrive at the destination, but you can't take any other creatures with you.</p><p>When casting the spell, you can designate a number of creatures equal to your caster level. These creatures can see and use the portal, passing through it to arrive at the destination (this isn't an action). A creature that passes through the portal can't take any other actions until its next turn.</p>
Discordant Blast	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage dealt increases to 5d6 points of sonic damage, and you gain a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to the bull rush opponents. The spell can penetrate non-mythic magical silence and dispels any non-mythic <i>silence</i> effect of 4th level or lower.</p>
Disfiguring Touch	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The target takes two different penalties (chosen from the same list) instead of one.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target also gains the fatigued condition because of its painful disfigurement. If this fatigue is negated without removing the curse, it returns after 1 hour.</p>
Disintegrate	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage dealt increases to 3d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 60d6) plus 1d4 points of Constitution damage. A creature that succeeds at its saving throw takes 5d8 points of damage plus 1 point of Constitution damage.</p><p>A creature whose Constitution score is reduced to 0 by this spell is entirely disintegrated.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (7th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you fire two rays.</p><p>Alternatively, you may fire only one ray, but if the target is a non-mythic creature and it fails its saving throw, it's automatically disintegrated regardless of its current hp.</p>
Dispel Magic	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>When used as a targeted dispel, this spell can end two spells affecting the target instead of just one. If the targeted dispel successfully dispels at least one spell, you heal 1d4 points of damage for every spell level of the dispelled spell. If you dispel two spells, this healing applies only to the highest-level spell dispelled. If you use this spell to counterspell, roll your dispel check twice and take the higher result.</p>
Divine Favor	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>You also gain the luck bonus on saving throws and skill checks. Alternatively, you can cast this spell on another willing creature, changing the range to touch and target to living creature touched.</p>
Divine Pursuit	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The speed of the movement form provided by the spell increases by 30 feet. This adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus. You gain a bonus on Perception and Survival skill checks attempted against the selected creature. This is a sacred bonus if you're good or a profane bonus if you're evil; if you're neutral, choose either the sacred or profane bonus.</p>
Dominate Person	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The Sense Motive DC to notice your target is dominated increases by double your tier. You can give orders to the target even if it's protected by non-mythic effects that block magical control, such as <i>protection from evil</i>. If the target is protected by a mythic effect, you can attempt to overcome this defense with a caster level check (DC 15 plus the caster level of the effect); add your tier to your roll and the opposing caster's tier to the DC. If the target succeeds at its Will save to break your control, as an immediate action you can expend one use of mythic power to force it to reroll the save and use the lower result.</p>
Draconic Reservoir	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The amount of energy damage the spell absorbs increases to 10 points per caster level (maximum 100 points). The energy damage from the weapons improves as if using a <i>corrosive burst</i>, <i>flaming burst</i>, <i>icy burst</i>, or <i>shocking burst</i> weapon.</p><h>Mythic Augmented (3rd)</h><p>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, spending a swift action applies the energy damage to any number of creatures the target hits this round, not just the first.</p>
Dragon's Breath	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The spell's duration changes to 1 minute/level or until discharged. You can use the breath weapon up to three times during this duration. On the round you cast the spell, using the breath weapon is a free action; later uses require a standard action. You must wait 1d4 rounds between each use of the breath weapon. All uses for a particular casting have the same range, area, and energy type. You can have only one <i>dragon's breath</i> spell in effect at a time; casting a new one ends the previous one.</p>
Dream	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>You or the messenger may gain information from the dreamer you contact by asking questions as if using <i>speak with dead</i> to speak with a corpse. An unwilling dreamer can attempt to resist this probing with a Will save (as <i>speak with dead</i>, using the DC <i>dream</i> would have if it allowed a saving throw). Answers to these questions are still generally brief and cryptic.</p>
Dust of Twilight	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>A creature that fails its Fortitude save against the spell must also succeed at a Will save at the same DC or fall asleep (as the <i>sleep</i> spell). Creatures that succeed at their saves are merely drowsy (as the <i>lullaby</i> spell).</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, add half your tier to the level of light spells <i>mythic dust of twilight </i>dispels.</p>
Ear-Piercing Scream	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage dealt increases to 1d8 points of sonic damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d8) and the duration that creatures in the area are dazed is a number of rounds equal to your tier.</p><h>Mythic Augmented (3rd)</h><p>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell affects a 30-foot cone rather than a single target.</p>
Earthquake	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Increase the damage dealt to structures by 10 points of damage per tier. Increase the damage dealt by cave-ins and landslides to 10d8 points of damage. Increase the damage dealt to those pinned beneath rubble to 1d10 points per minute. Add your tier to the DC of concentration checks and Constitution checks attempted as a consequence of this spell.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (8th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell lasts for an additional round and the spread's radius increases by 20 feet. Each round this spell is in effect, on your turn you may expend one use of mythic power to continue its duration for 1 round and increase its radius by another 20 feet.</p>
Elemental Body (all)	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Each <i>mythic elemental body</i> spell must be learned individually, and you must know the respective non-mythic <i>elemental body</i> spell to learn its mythic version. You don't have to learn them in order, and aren't required to know a lower-level <i>mythic elemental body</i> spell before you learn a higher-level one (for example, you can learn <i>mythic elemental body II </i>if you know <i>elemental body II</i>, even if you don't know <i>mythic elemental body I</i>). Each <i>mythic elemental body</i> spell adds the following benefits to its respective non-mythic version.</p><p>The spell's bonuses to ability scores increase by 2, the natural armor bonus increases by 1, and the ability score penalties decrease by 2 (minimum penalty of 0). There is a 50% chance any critical hit or sneak attack against you is treated as a normal hit, as if you were wearing <i>medium fortification</i> armor.</p><h>Mythic Augmented (3rd)</h><p>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the ability score bonuses increase by an additional 2. You can also, a number of times equal to your tier, add half your tier to the DC of one spell you cast with an energy descriptor that matches your elemental type (air: electricity, earth: acid, fire: fire, water: cold).</p>
Endure Elements	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The target changes to one creature touched per level. Affected creatures gain cold resistance 5 and fire resistance 5. They're not slowed by snow, and ignore penalties on Perception checks and ranged weapon attacks from hail, rain, sleet, and snow. They treat wind as one category weaker.</p>
Enemy Hammer	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The target becomes entangled whether or not it succeeds at its saving throw. When using the target as a weapon, add half your tier to your attack roll, and add your tier to the damage roll.</p><h>Mythic Augmented (3rd)</h><p>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, when you use the target to hit a creature, you can attempt a free bull rush combat maneuver against that creature. Your CMB for this maneuver is equal to your attack bonus for <i>mythic enemy hammer</i>, except you add your tier instead of half your tier.</p>
Enervation	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The number of negative levels inflicted increases to 1d6, and the target is sickened for 24 hours. An undead creature struck by the ray gains 1d6 x 5 temporary hit points for a number of hours equal to your caster level.</p><h>Mythic Augmented (3rd)</h><p>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, any creature attempting to remove the target's negative levels must succeed at a caster level check (DC 10 + your caster level + your tier).</p>
Enlarge Person	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>You can increase the target's size by up to two size categories, to a maximum of Huge. If the target grows two sizes, its weight increases by a factor of 25, it gains a +4 size bonus to Strength, and takes a -4 size penalty to Dexterity and a -2 penalty on attack rolls and to AC because of its increased size. A Medium humanoid creature whose size increases to Huge has a space of 15 feet and a natural reach of 10 feet. <i>Mythic enlarge person</i> counters and dispels <i>mythic reduce person</i>.</p>
Entangle	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The spell functions in areas without any vegetation, causing plants to spring up out of the ground. These plants can reach creatures that are up to 10 feet in the air. Plants affected or created by the spell sprout thorns that deal 1d6 points of damage each round to creatures in the area.</p>
Entropic Shield	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>When a ranged attack misses because of this spell, there is a 50% chance that the attack is redirected back at the attacker rather than just being deflected harmlessly. The attack uses the same result as the attack roll the attacker made against you.</p>
Expeditious Retreat	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The speed bonus from the spell increases to 40 feet. Add your tier to Acrobatics checks to avoid attacks of opportunity from movement, and when your movement provokes an attack of opportunity, add your tier to your AC against that attack.</p>
Faerie Fire	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Outlined creatures are dazzled. The spell outlines figment illusions in the burst, revealing them as such. This effect applies only to figments with a caster level equal to or less than your tier.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (2nd)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, each creature in the burst must succeed at a Fortitude save or be blinded for 1 round.</p>
False Life	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The temporary hit points gained increase to 2d8 + 2 per caster level (maximum +20). As an immediate action, you can dismiss the remaining duration of the spell to prevent 1 point of Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution damage per 10 temporary hit points remaining from the spell. This takes effect after the attack hits you and the damage is rolled, but before you take the damage. For example, if you have 22 temporary hit points from <i>mythic false life</i> and a wyvern stings you for 3 points of Constitution damage, you can dismiss the spell to prevent 2 points of Constitution damage from that attack.</p>
Feast of Ashes	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>On a failed save, the target immediately takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per tier. Add your tier to the DC of any further Constitution checks the target attempts to resist the effects of starvation as part of this spell's effects. While the curse is in effect, the target gains no benefit from any spell, effect, or item that requires eating, such as the food from a <i>heroes' feast</i> spell (though the food is still used up when the target eats it).</p>
Feather Fall	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The spell affects one additional target per level. The targets don't have to be within 20 feet of each other.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (4th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell absorbs the targets' velocity and transforms it into a concussive blast. Targets fall at the normal rate (not slowed) but land safely. When a target lands, it creates a 10-foot-radius burst of force that deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 5d6, Reflex half, DC equal to the DC of <i>feather fall</i>). The targets of this spell are unaffected by these concussive blasts.</p>
Finger of Death	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage dealt increases to 15 points of damage per caster level plus 1d8 points of Constitution damage. A creature that succeeds at its saving throw takes 3d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level, takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage, and is staggered for 1 round.</p>
Fireball	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage dealt increases to 1d10 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d10). Any creature that fails its Reflex saving throw catches on fire, taking 2d6 points of fire damage each round until the fire is extinguished. Attempts to extinguish this fire use the spell's save DC.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (6th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the maximum damage increases to 20d10, the area increases to a 40-foot radius spread, and any fire damage dealt by the spell bypasses fire resistance and fire immunity.</p>
Fire Seeds	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Each acorn's damage increases to 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d6 for all acorns, no more than 10d6 for any particular acorn). Each holly berry's damage increases to 2d6 points of fire damage + 2 points per caster level. Any creature that fails its Reflex save against an acorn or holly berry catches on fire, taking 2d6 points of fire damage each round until the fire is extinguished. Attempts to extinguish this fire use the spell's save DC.</p>
Fire Shield	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage dealt to your attackers increases to 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). A chill shield gives you fire immunity. A warm shield gives you cold immunity.</p>
Fire Snake	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage dealt increases to 1d10 points of damage per level (maximum 15d10). Any creature that fails its saving throw against the spell is grappled by a snake made of fire that lasts for 1 round per caster level. The snake can be dispelled, but not attacked. A grappled creature takes 1d10 points of fire damage on your turn each round. The snake's CMB is equal to your caster level plus your tier, and its CMD is equal to its CMB + 10.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (6th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the maximum damage increases to 20d10, and any creature that fails its saving throw against the spell is pinned instead of grappled.</p>
Fire Storm	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage dealt increases to 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d8). Half of this damage is fire damage, and the other half is divine energy that bypasses fire resistance and fire immunity. You can exclude any number of animals from damage just as you can plant creatures.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (8th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, choose one creature type (and subtype, if humanoid or outsider) to exclude from the effects of the spell. For each additional use of mythic power you expend when casting the spell, exclude another creature type. For example, if you expend two uses of mythic power and choose magical beasts, you can exclude from damage any number of magical beasts in the spell's area.</p>
Firestream	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage dealt increases to 2d10 points of fire damage. Any creature that fails its saving throw also catches fire. The continuous line of fire pushes against all creatures, making them treat the spell's area as difficult terrain.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (4th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you create a second line of fire using your other hand. If you overlap the lines, creatures in the overlap must attempt two saving throws and take the lower result, but don't take damage from both lines. You may stop either line of fire as a free action on your turn, but once you stop maintaining a line, you must cast <i>mythic firestream</i> again to recreate it.</p>
Flame Blade	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The blade's damage increases to 2d6 points of fire damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20). The blade threatens a critical hit on a natural 18-20 as if it were an actual scimitar.</p><h>Mythic Augmented (3rd)</h><p>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the blade threatens a critical hit on a natural 15-20, and bypasses hardness, fire resistance, and fire immunity.</p>
Flames of the Faithful	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The fire damage dealt by this spell bypasses fire resistance and fire immunity. On a successful critical hit, the target catches on fire.</p>
Flame Strike	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage dealt increases to 1d8 per caster level (maximum 15d8). The area increases to a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder. You may have the divine half of the damage affect only one specific creature type (as the <i>bane</i> weapon quality).</p>
Flesh to Stone	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>A creature that succeeds at its saving throw is partially petrified, becoming slowed (as the <i>slow</i> spell) for a number of rounds equal to your tier. The creature can end this effect early by spending a full-round action breaking away its own petrified flesh, dealing 5d10 points of damage to itself. Any effect that removes or reverses petrification negates this partial petrification and the <i>slow</i> effect.</p><p>The spell can affect objects and undead, as long as the target is primarily made of flesh or bone, such as a corpse or zombie. The spell doesn't affect the target's gear. If cast on a creature with equipment, the creature transforms into stone but its gear doesn't.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (9th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, any Large or smaller creature fully petrified by the spell immediately animates and follows your commands, as if you had cast <i>animate objects</i>.</p>
Floating Disk	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The disk created by this spell lasts for 2 hours per caster level and can carry up to 200 pounds of weight per caster level.</p><p>The disk accompanies you regardless of your speed, always catching up no matter how far you move. If you stand or sit on the disk, as a move action you can direct it to travel up to 30 feet in any direction.</p><p>Any objects resting on the disk count as weightless parts of your gear for the purpose of teleportation effects (allowing these items to go with you when you teleport despite the weight limit of the <i>teleportation</i> spell).</p><p>As a free action, you can transform the plane of force from a concave disk into a bucket-like shape that holds up to 4 gallons (or transform it from the bucket-like form back to its normal disk form).</p>
Fly	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The fly speed changes to 120 feet (or 80 feet if the target is wearing medium or heavy armor, or carrying a medium or heavy load) with perfect maneuverability. When the duration expires, the target is protected by <i>feather fall</i> for a number of rounds equal to your caster level.</p><h>Mythic Augmented (3rd)</h><p>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target adds your tier on Reflex saves and as a dodge bonus to AC. It gains these bonuses only while flying.</p>
Fog Cloud	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The radius of the fog increases to 50 feet.</p><h>Mythic Augmented (3rd)</h><p>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the fog's radius changes to 500 feet, and its height changes to 100 feet. Winds can't dissipate the fog unless the area of the wind affects the entire area of the augmented <i>mythic fog cloud</i>.</p><p>If you're at least 6th tier and instead expend three uses of mythic power, the range increases to 1 mile, the fog's radius changes to 1 mile, and its height changes to 500 feet. The cloud is as resistant to wind as the 3rd-tier augmented version.</p>
Force Punch	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage dealt increases to 1d6 points of force damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). If moving the target would push it into another creature's space and it has at least 10 feet of distance remaining, you can attempt to overrun the other creature, adding your tier on the combat maneuver check. For each creature you overrun with the target, reduce the distance the target moves by 5 feet. If moving the target would push it into a solid obstacle (such as a wall or tree), the target takes damage as if it had fallen the distance pushed.</p><h>Mythic Augmented (3rd)</h><p>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can cast this spell as a ranged touch attack with a range of close (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels), and the target is treated as two size categories smaller for the purpose of determining the total distance pushed.</p>
Foresight	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The spell's insight bonus increases to +3. If you cast the spell on another creature, you and the target are simultaneously warned by the spell, and the target gains the spell's insight bonuses.</p>
Form of the Dragon (All)	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Each <i>mythic form of the dragon</i> spell must be learned individually, and you must know the respective non-mythic <i>form of the dragon</i> spell to learn its mythic version. You don't have to learn them in order, and aren't required to know a lower-level <i>mythic form of the dragon</i> spell before you learn a higher-level one (for example, you can learn <i>mythic form of the dragon II </i>if you know <i>form of the dragon II</i>, even if you don't know <i>mythic form of the dragon I</i>). Each <i>mythic form of the dragon</i> spell adds the following benefits to its respective non-mythic version.</p><p>The spell's bonuses to ability scores increase by 2, the natural armor bonus increases by 1, and the breath weapon damage increases to 10d6. All of the dragon form's natural attacks increase by one step (see Improved Natural Attack).</p><h>Mythic Augmented (3rd)</h><p>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the ability score bonuses increase by an additional 2.

Gaseous Form	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage reduction changes to DR 10/epic and magic, and the fly speed increases to 30 feet. The target can expand itself as a free action, filling an area equal to double its normal space and height (a Medium creature fills a 10-foot-by-10-foot space to a height of about 10 feet) and blocking vision as <i>obscuring mist</i>. Returning from expanded to normal size is also a free action.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target can shift into or out of gaseous form as a move action.</p>
Giant Vermin	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The vermin you transform with this spell gain DR 5/magic and either the advanced creature template or the giant creature template.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (6th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, any vermin you transform also gains either the agile or savage mythic template while the spell lasts.</p><p>If you're at least 9th tier and expend three uses of mythic power, the duration changes to instantaneous, meaning the vermin retain their giant size. After a number of days equal to your tier, you lose control over the vermin unless you have some other way of controlling them, and they lose the agile or savage mythic template but retain the advanced or giant creature template.</p>
Globe of Invulnerability	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Add half your tier to the level of non-mythic spells the globe excludes. The globe excludes mythic spells of 4th level or lower.</p>
Glyph of Warding	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Add your tier to the DC to detect or disable the glyph. Blast glyph damage increases to 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6). Add half your tier to the maximum spell level you can store in a spell glyph.</p>

The maximum level of the imbued spell is equal to half your tier, and you must expend one use of mythic power for each spell level of the imbued spell (in addition to the one use needed to cast <i>mythic goodberry</i>). Similar to <i>imbue with spell ability</i>, you can't prepare a spell in that spell's slot until the berry is consumed or the <i>mythic goodberry</i> spell ends.</p>
Grease	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>If you cast <i>mythic grease</i> on an area, add your tier to the Acrobatics DC to move within or through the area. If you cast it on a creature's armor or clothing, add your tier to its Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks attempted to escape a grapple and to its CMD to avoid being grappled.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented</h>: You can expend two uses of mythic power to make the grease flammable. It ignites from any fire at least the size of a candle flame. If a greased area is ignited, any creature in the area on your turn takes 1d3 points of fire damage and might catch on fire. If a greased creature is ignited, it takes 2d6 points of fire damage, and might catch on fire; add your tier to the save DC.</p>
Guards and Wards	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>You are alerted whenever any creature enters the warded area as if by a mental <i>alarm</i> spell as long as you're on the same plane as the warded area. At will, you can concentrate to observe the warded area as if using <i>arcane eye</i>. When you start concentrating, the sensor always appears at a point you designate when you cast the spell. You can place two of the five effects listed in the spell (<i>dancing lights</i> and so on) instead of one.</p><h>Mythic Augmented (3rd)</h><p>: You can place the following effects anywhere within the warded area by expending one additional use of mythic power per effect.</p><p>6. <i>Black tentacles</i> in one place, returning after 10 minutes if dispelled.</p><p>7. <i>Dispel magic</i> in one place.

Gust of Wind	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The force of the wind increases to windstorm (approximately 70 mph). All effects described in the spell affect creatures one size larger. Ranged attacks can't be attempted in the area of the spell. The wind automatically blows out unprotected flames and has a 75% chance of blowing out protected flames.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (2nd)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell lasts for 1 additional round and the range increases by 30 feet. As a swift action at the start of your turn, you can expend another use of mythic power to extend the duration by 1 round and the range by another 30 feet.</p>
Harm	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage dealt increases to 15 points of damage per caster level (maximum 225 points).</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell also acts as <i>poison</i>.</p>

The movement speed increase changes to 50 feet, to a maximum of three times the creature's normal speed for that movement type.</p><h>Mythic Augmented (3rd)</h><p>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the movement speed increase changes to 70 feet, with no limit based on the creature's normal speed. If an affected creature moves at least 30 feet on its turn, it can travel across liquid as if the liquid were solid. If the liquid deals damage on contact, the creature takes only half damage from moving across it.</p>
Heal	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage cured increases to 15 points of damage per caster level (maximum 225 points).</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell also acts as <i>restoration</i>.</p>
Healing Thief	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Instead of stealing half the target's healing, you steal all of it. The amount of damage you steal before the spell is discharged increases to 10 points per caster level (maximum 100 points).</p><h>Mythic Augmented (3rd)</h><p>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the range of the spell changes to close (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels).

Healing from these abilities count toward the maximum healing stolen before the spell is discharged.</p>
Heat Metal	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage dealt increases to 1d8 points of fire damage on rounds 2 and 6 and to 2d8 points of fire damage per round on rounds 3 through 5. On any round in which a creature takes fire damage from this spell, that creature must succeed at a Reflex save or catch on fire.</p>
Heroism	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The morale bonus increases to +4 and applies on all checks, attack rolls, saves, and weapon damage rolls. Allies adjacent to the target gain a +4 morale bonus on saves against fear effects.</p><h>Mythic Augmented (3rd)</h><p>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target can attempt one additional attack per round when taking a full attack action (as if using a <i>haste</i> spell). The target can use this additional attack ability a number of times equal to your tier.</p>
Hex Ward	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The target gains immunity to one witch hex (but not a major hex or grand hex) of your choice.</p><h>Mythic Augmented (3rd)</h><p>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, instead of granting immunity to one witch hex, you can grant immunity to two hexes or one major hex.</p><p>If you're at least 6th tier and expend three uses of mythic power, you instead grant immunity to three hexes, two major hexes, or one grand hex.</p>
Hideous Laughter	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>A creature of a type different than your own doesn't gain a bonus on its saving throws against this spell. The affected target laughs so hard it hurts, and takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage each round it spends laughing.</p><p>If the target fails its initial save, it must succeed at two follow-up saving throws (each a full-round action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity) to end the spell. Succeeding at only one save means the spell no longer deals damage, but the target is still unable to take actions.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target's laughter becomes contagious. When the target's allies are within 30 feet and can hear the laugh, they must successfully save against the spell or be sickened until the target stops laughing. The sickened effect ends if the ally moves more than 30 feet from the target or is unable to hear the target's laughter for an entire round.</p>
Hold Portal	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The target portal can be as large as 30 square feet per caster level. A creature attempting to force open the portal must first succeed at a Will save against the spell's DC. This is a mind-affecting effect. Failure means the creature can't open the door while the spell is in effect.</p>
Holy Smite	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage dealt to evil outsiders increases to 1d10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d10) and the damage dealt to other evil creatures increases to 1d12 points of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d12). The duration that creatures in the area are blinded increases to 2 rounds. On a successful save, an evil creature is blinded for 1 round.</p>
Holy Word	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>When determining the spell's effect on non-mythic creatures, add your tier to your caster level. Nongood creatures that fail their saves also take a -4 penalty on attack rolls and saving throws, and their spell resistance decreases by 5 for as long as the spell's other effects last.</p>
Hydraulic Push	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The water is boiling hot or freezing cold, dealing 1d6 points of fire or cold damage per 2 caster levels. Add your tier to your CMB for the spell.</p>
Hydraulic Torrent	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The water is boiling hot or freezing cold, dealing 1d6 points of fire or cold damage per 2 caster levels. Add your tier to your CMB for the spell and on the Strength check to destroy immovable targets.</p><h>Mythic Augmented (3rd)</h><p>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell can extinguish magical fires as if using a targeted <i>dispel magic</i>. Freezing cold water hardens into ice on the ground, lasting as long as prevailing conditions allow. Boiling hot water turns into steam, creating an area of concealing mist (equivalent to <i>obscuring mist</i>) that fills the affected squares and all squares adjacent to the line of the spell.</p>
Ice Storm	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The bludgeoning damage increases to 4d8 points of damage and the cold damage increases to 3d6 points of damage. The ground in the area is covered in ice and hailstones, acting as though a <i>grease</i> spell were cast on it. Dealing 5 or more points of fire damage to a square melts the ice and hail, negating the <i>grease</i> effect.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (6th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, one creature in the area is paralyzed (as if by <i>hold person</i>) and gains vulnerability to fire as long as it's paralyzed.</p>
Ill Omen	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>For the target's unlucky d20 rolls, it must roll three times and take the lowest result. Spending a move action to utter a prayer or good luck charm allows the target to roll twice instead of three times.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (4th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you afflict the target with especially foul luck. Any natural 20 it rolls counts as a natural 1 instead.</p>
Inflict Critical Wounds	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage dealt increases to 8d8 points of damage + 2 points per caster level (maximum +40). A living target is sickened for 1 round per caster level (maximum 20 rounds) if it fails its saving throw.</p>
Inflict Light Wounds	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage dealt increases to 2d8 points of damage + 2 points per caster level (maximum +10). A living target is sickened for 1 round per caster level (maximum 5 rounds) if it fails its saving throw.</p>
Inflict Moderate Wounds	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage dealt increases to 4d8 points of damage + 2 points per caster level (maximum +20). A living target is sickened for 1 round per caster level (maximum 10 rounds) if it fails its saving throw.</p>
Inflict Serious Wounds	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage dealt increases to 6d8 points of damage + 2 points per caster level (maximum +30). A living target is sickened for 1 round per caster level (maximum 15 rounds) if it fails its saving throw.</p>
Invisibility	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The invisible target can't be detected with <i>detect magic</i> or other spells that detect magic auras. The invisibility can't be penetrated, revealed, or dispelled by spells of 2nd level or lower (such as <i>see invisibility</i> or <i>glitterdust</i>), though <i>true seeing</i> and <i>dust of appearance</i> can reveal the invisible target's presence.</p><h>Mythic Augmented (3rd)</h><p>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the invisible target is undetectable by blindsense, blindsight, scent, and tremorsense.</p>
Irresistible Dance	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>When casting the spell, you can choose to make the dance either an unending dance or a dance of death.</p><p>A target affected by unending dance receives a new saving throw at the end of each round of dancing, even if its initial save was successful. If the save fails, the duration of the spell increases by 1 round.</p><p>A target affected by the dance of death suffers excruciating pain that inflicts a -4 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks, and it takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round it spends dancing.</p><p>With either form, you can direct the creature like a marionette as a move action, causing it to take a single move action at half its speed along the path you specify. You must have line of sight to the target and be within Medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per caster level) to command its movement. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal, and doesn't count against the target's movement on its turn. You can't move a target that succeeded at its initial save against the spell.</p>
Jitterbugs	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Starting on the second round of the spell, the affected target must succeed at a Fortitude save on your turn or be nauseated for 1 round, as if distracted by an actual swarm.</p>
Knock	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The spell unlocks up to three means of closure instead of two. The spell automatically opens locks of simple or average quality, without requiring a caster level check to do so). If used on a door locked with <i>arcane lock</i>, you can attempt a free dispel check against it as if using a targeted <i>dispel magic</i>, adding your tier to the check.</p><h>Mythic Augmented (3rd)</h><p>: You can expend two uses of mythic power to target one locked item per tier, unlocking up to four means of closure on each, allowing a free dispel against an <i>arcane lock</i> on each, and automatically opening locks of up to good quality (no caster level check needed).</p><p>If the door has a trap that triggers when opened, you become aware of the trap and its general nature, and the door is unlocked but doesn't automatically open.</p><p>The spell can raise a barred gate, portcullis, or similar impediment, but each one counts as two locked doors.</p>
Know the Enemy	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The insight bonus increases to +15 plus your tier. If the check is successful, you gain a +5 insight bonus on your next attack roll or saving throw against a creature of that type, as long as the roll occurs within 24 hours of casting the spell.</p>
Levitate	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Instead of affecting one creature, you can affect a number of targets up to your caster level, but the total weight supported can be no more than 100 pounds per caster level. You can spend a move action to mentally direct all targets, but you must move all of them identically.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (8th)</h>: If you expend 10 uses of mythic power, you permanently levitate a 5-foot cube of rock, which you can move 20 feet vertically or horizontally as a move action.</p><p>If you have created multiple cubes and they are physically touching each other, you can direct them all as a single move action (as if they were one object), even if some of them are out of range. Each levitating cube can support approximately 1,000 pounds of weight, allowing you to use it as a portion of the foundation for a bridge, floating castle, or similar construction project.</p>
Lightning Arc	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage dealt increases to 1d8 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 15d8). A target that fails its save is blinded by the flash for 1 round and deafened by thunder for 1d4 rounds.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (6th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the two targets can be up to 120 feet apart, the lightning can turn once up to 90 degrees to connect the targets, and the spell's electrical damage bypasses electricity resistance and electricity immunity.</p>
Limited Wish	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>When using <i>mythic limited wish</i> to duplicate another spell, you can duplicate a mythic spell you know (if you're a spontaneous caster) or have prepared (if you're a caster who prepares spells). If you don't know or haven't prepared the mythic spell, you can expend a second use of mythic power duplicate the mythic version of the desired spell.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can cast a silent, stilled <i>mythic limited wish</i>, even if you're helpless or couldn't otherwise take actions (but not unconscious).</p>
Mage Armor	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The armor bonus increases to +6. There is a 50% chance that any critical hit or sneak attack made against the target is negated and treated as a normal hit, as if the target were wearing <i>moderate fortification</i> armor.</p>
Mage's Disjunction	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The duration increases to 10 minutes per caster level. The chance to destroy an <i>antimagic field</i> increases to 2% per caster level.</p>
Magic Fang	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The spell affects an additional number of the target's natural weapons equal to your tier. For example, if you're 3rd tier, it could affect two claws and one bite).</p>
Magic Fang, Greater	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>This functions like <i>mythic magic fang</i>. You can add one of the following weapon special abilities to natural attacks or unarmed strikes affected by the spell: <i>flaming</i>, <i>frost</i>, <i>keen</i>, <i>merciful</i>, <i>shock</i>, or <i>thundering</i>. You must choose only one with each casting of the spell. For example, you can't add <i>flaming</i> to a tiger's bite and <i>keen</i> to its claws with the same casting. If the target has an Intelligence score less than 3, these abilities are always on (the target can't activate or deactivate the effect) and it might react with fear if its attacks make noise or create visible energy.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (5th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can reduce the granted enhancement bonuses by 1 to add two of the above abilities or one of the following abilities: <i>flaming burst</i>, <i>icy burst</i>, or <i>shocking burst</i>.</p>
Magic Missile	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage dealt by each missile increases to 2d4+1. The missiles bypass the <i>shield</i> spell and similar effects that block the non-mythic version of this spell.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (4th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell creates double the normal number of missiles (affecting up to 10 creatures), its range increases to line of sight, and it bypasses the targets' spell resistance and spell immunity.</p>
Magic Vestment	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>You can add one armor special ability to the target if it's armor or one shield special ability if it's a shield. The special ability must have a base price modifier no greater than a +1 enhancement bonus or 4,000 gp.</p><h>Mythic Augmented (3rd)</h><p>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can add any number of special abilities with a total base price modifier no greater than a +2 enhancement bonus or 15,000 gp.</p>
Magic Weapon, Greater	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>You can add one of the following weapon special abilities to the weapon: <i>flaming</i>, <i>frost</i>, <i>keen</i>, <i>merciful</i>, <i>shock</i>, or <i>thundering</i>.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (5th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can reduce the granted enhancement bonus by 1 to add two of the above abilities or one of the following abilities: <i>anarchic</i>, <i>axiomatic</i>, <i>flaming burst</i>, <i>holy</i>, <i>icy burst</i>, <i>shocking burst</i>, or <i>unholy</i>.</p>
Make Whole	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage the spell repairs increases to 2d6 points of damage per caster level when cast on a construct creature (maximum 10d6). A construct repaired with this spell gains a +2 enhancement bonus on an ability score of your choice for the next 24 hours. To repair a magic item, your caster level has to equal to only the caster level of the magic item, not double the caster level.</p>
Maze	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>A spectral minotaur hunts the target trapped in the maze. Every round the creature fails to escape from the maze, it takes 2d8 + your tier points of piercing and slashing damage from this phantom opponent.</p>
Memory Lapse	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The target forgets an additional round, back to the beginning of the turn before its last turn.</p><h>Mythic Augmented (3rd)</h><p>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can spend 1 round implanting a false memory in the affected target. This false memory is limited to events that could have occurred during the time it just forgot, as if using <i>modify memory</i> but limited to that short period of time. For example, you couldn't implant the memory of a lengthy conversation, as that couldn't happen in the forgotten length of time.</p><p>The target can attempt a Will saving throw (DC equal to the <i>mythic memory lapse</i> DC plus your tier) to resist this implanted memory. Success means no memory is implanted, but the target still forgets the allotted time.</p>
Meteor Swarm	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The meteors created by this spell deal bludgeoning damage in a line extending from you to the target destination where it explodes. Creatures in the path of a meteor take 2d10 points of bludgeoning damage and must succeed at a Fortitude save or be knocked prone. The damage from the exploding meteors increases to 6d10 points of fire damage. Creatures that fail their Reflex saves against the fire damage are also knocked prone and deafened for 1d4 rounds.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (10th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, creatures in the path of a meteor also take 4d10 points of fire damage and the damage from the exploding meteors increases to 10d10 points of fire damage; this fire damage bypasses fire resistance and fire immunity.</p>
Mighty Fist of the Earth	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Add your tier to the rock's attack roll and damage roll. Increase the critical multiplier of the attack by 1 (maximum x4).</p>
Mirror Image	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The maximum number of images generated by this spell increases to 12. Destroying an image creates a flash of light. Any creature that destroys an image must succeed at a Will save or be dazzled for 1 round.</p>
Mislead	"<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>You create one illusory double per 5 caster levels, each of which appears in your square or in an unoccupied square adjacent to yours. When you cast the spell, you can give each of these doubles a simple programmed task as a telepathic command, such a ""walk south,"" ""beg for mercy,"" or ""follow that troll.""</p><p>You can change or modify a single illusory double's programmed task by spending a swift, move, or standard action; this requires concentration.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (4th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, this spell also grants you the benefits of augmented <i>mythic invisibility</i> instead of <i>greater invisibility</i>.</p>"
Modify Memory	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>You can modify an additional 5 minutes of the subject's memory per tier. You may affect multiple memories with one casting of the spell, as long as the total number of minutes doesn't exceed this limit. Each affected memory counts as a minimum of 5 minutes. For example, you could implant a memory of having a brief meeting with the mayor before lunch and another brief meeting just after dinner, even though the two events would have been hours apart.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (8th)</h>: If you expend four uses of mythic power, instead of altering the target's memories, you alter all other creatures' memories of the target (only the target gets a saving throw against the spell). All creatures on the same plane as the target forget his name, their relationship to him, and everything he has done; he is essentially a stranger to them. Any important acts by the target are attributed to someone else. Everyone's memories of history are rewritten to incorporate this change. The target's memories are unaffected. You can exclude a number of other creatures up to your tier from the effects of this spell (so they remember the truth), including yourself if you wish. Written records are unchanged unless you expend an additional six uses of mythic power when you cast the spell, and written records on other planes remain unchanged regardless.</p>
Monstrous Physique (all)	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Each <i>mythic monstrous physique</i> spell must be learned individually, and you must know the respective non-mythic <i>monstrous physique</i> spell to learn its mythic version. You don't have to learn them in order, and aren't required to know a lower-level <i>mythic monstrous physique</i> spell before you learn a higher-level one (for example, you can learn <i>mythic monstrous physique II </i>if you know <i>monstrous physique II</i>, even if you don't know <i>mythic monstrous physique I</i>). Each <i>mythic monstrous physique</i> spell adds the following benefits to its respective non-mythic version.</p><p>The spell's bonuses to ability scores increase by 2 each, the natural armor bonus increases by 1, and the ability score penalties decrease by 2 each (minimum penalty of 0). Alternatively, you can cast this spell on another willing creature, changing the range to touch and the target to one creature.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (4th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the ability score bonuses increase by an additional 2. Additionally, you can cast this spell on other willing creatures, changing the range to touch and the target to one creature per tier.</p>
Move Earth	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>This spell can move earth much more quickly, with each full round of casting allowing you to reshape a 25-foot-square area up to 10 feet deep. All creatures on or under the ground within that area are knocked prone and moved to the closest square outside the area being shaped. A successful Reflex save prevents a creature from being knocked prone, but it's still moved.</p>
Murderous Command	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>This spell lasts for a number of rounds equal to your tier. Each round after the first, the target can attempt a new saving throw at the beginning of its turn to break free of the spell.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target attacks its nearest ally with its most powerful spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability. If it has no such ability, it attacks the ally with a melee weapon or natural weapon as normal and gains a +4 morale bonus on the attack and damage rolls.</p>
Named Bullet	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Increase the critical multiplier of the target weapon by 1 (maximum x4).</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (2nd)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target ammunition or weapon returns to the creature that shot or threw it just before that creature's next turn (similar to a <i>returning</i> weapon). The spell isn't discharged until the target is used to attempt a second attack against the named creature. Ammunition that hits is destroyed and doesn't return.</p>
Nightmare	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The spell's damage increases to 4d6 points of damage, and the target is also shaken for 24 hours.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (6th)</h>: You can deliver a mind-affecting spell through a <i>mythic nightmare</i>. The maximum level of the delivered spell is equal to half your tier, and you must expend one use of mythic power for each spell level of the imbued spell in addition to the one use needed to cast <i>mythic nightmare</i>. You choose whether the delivered spell affects the creature immediately or when it awakens. The delivered spell affects only the target, even if it normally affects multiple creatures or an area.</p>
Oath of Peace	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>You don't provoke attacks of opportunity when you attempt Heal checks, cast targeted spells with the harmless descriptor, or use positive energy effects to heal living creatures.</p>
Obscuring Mist	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The range increases to 50 feet, and the cloud's radius and height both increase to 50 feet.</p><h>Mythic Augmented (3rd)</h><p>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the range increases to 500 feet. The cloud's radius increases to 500 feet, and its height increases to 100 feet. Winds can't dissipate the mist unless the area of the wind affects the entire area of this spell. Areas of mist burned away by fire spells become obscured again 1d4 rounds after the fire effect ends.</p><p>If you're at least 6th tier and expend three uses of mythic power, the range increases to 1 mile, the cloud radius increases to 1 mile, and its height increases to 500 feet. The cloud is as resistant to wind and fire effects as the 3rd-tier version.</p>
Orb of the Void	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>A creature that fails its save against the orb gains 2 negative levels rather than 1. A successful Fortitude save reduces this to 1 negative level.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (6th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the orb doesn't automatically stop when in enters a space with a living creature, but the saving throw DC decreases by 2 for each creature after the first it affects each round.</p><p>An individual creature can be affected by the <i>orb of the void</i> only once per round, even if the orb moves through its space more than once.</p>
Order's Wrath	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage dealt to chaotic outsiders increases to 1d10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d10) and the damage to other chaotic creatures increases to 1d12 points of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d12). The duration that creatures in the area are dazed increases to 2 rounds. Chaotic creatures that succeed at their saves are dazed for 1 round.</p>
Pernicious Poison	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The number of successful saving throws needed to cure a poison increases by one. If the poison deals ability damage on a failed saving throw, that ability damage increases by 1.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (6th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target's penalty on saves against poison increases to -8, and the penalty for attempting to cure the target with skill or magic increases to -8.</p><p>If you expend three uses of mythic power, the poison bypasses the creature's poison immunity (this doesn't affect poison immunity from not having a Constitution score).</p>
Phantasmal Killer	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>If the target fails its Will save but succeeds at its Fortitude save, the phantasmal killer persists in the target's mind, giving it the dazed condition until your next turn. On your next turn, the target must attempt another Fortitude save against the phantasm. Success means it takes 3d6 points of damage; failure means it dies from fear.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (6th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell can affect a living target that is immune to fear, illusions, or mind-affecting effects.</p>
Phantom Steed	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The steed's rider automatically succeeds at Ride checks to remain mounted. The mount's hit points increase to 10 plus 2 per caster level, and its speed increases to 30 feet per 2 caster levels (maximum 150 feet).</p><h>Mythic Augmented (3rd)</h><p>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the phantom steed is incorporeal, but its rider can interact with it normally.</p>
Pillar of Life	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage healed increases to 3d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20). The damage dealt to undead increases to 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d8), or 2d6 points of damage per caster level for undead vulnerable to bright light (maximum 20d6). If a dead creature is brought into the pillar's square and that creature could be revived by <i>breath of life</i>, the <i>pillar of life</i> ends and the creature returns to life as per <i>breath of life</i>.</p>
Plane Shift	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>If you've been to the destination plane and are familiar with a location there, you may choose that location and arrive on target at that location with anyone else you transport with the spell.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you grant transported creatures the effects of a <i>planar adaptation</i> spell upon arrival, lasting for 1 hour.</p>
Polar Ray	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage dealt increases to 1d8 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 25d8) and 1d6 points of Dexterity drain. If the target takes damage from this spell, it becomes partially encased in ice, reducing its speed by half. Creatures with the cold or incorporeal subtypes or immunity to being grappled are immune to this effect. The reduced movement lasts until the ice is destroyed. Destroying the ice requires a successful Strength or dispel check against the spell's DC or dealing 1 point of bludgeoning or fire damage per caster level to the target.</p>
Power Word Blind	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Treat the target's current hit point total as though it were lowered by 5 times your tier. For example, a 3rd-tier archmage casting <i>mythic power word blind</i> would affect a creature with 60 hp as though it had 45 hp, and the spell would permanently blind the target.</p><p>You can target a creature with more hit points than this spell could normally affect, causing it to treat all opponents as though they had concealment (20% miss chance) for 1d4 rounds.</p><h>Mythic Augmented (3rd)</h><p>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the magic of the word lingers around the target. Until the beginning of your next turn, if the target's hit points are reduced enough to put it in a lower category for the spell's effects, the spell affects the creature according to its new hit point total. For example, a creature in the 101-200 hp category reduced to 80 hp immediately becomes blinded for 1d4+1 minutes instead of 1d4+1 rounds. The spell's effects don't diminish if the target regains hit points.</p>
Power Word Kill	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Treat the target's current hit point total as though it were lowered by 5 times your tier. For example, a 3rd-tier archmage casting <i>mythic power word kill</i> would instantly kill a creature with 85 hit points or fewer.</p><p>You can target a creature with more hit points than this spell could normally affect, causing it to become exhausted.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (6th)</h>: If you expend four uses of mythic power, the magic of the word lingers around the target. Until the beginning of your next turn, if the target's hit point total drops to the point that this spell would have killed it upon casting, it's instantly slain.</p>
Power Word Stun	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Treat the target's current hit point total as though it were lowered by 5 times your tier. For example, a 3rd-tier archmage casting this spell would affect a creature with 60 hp as though it had 45 hp, and the spell would last an additional 2d4 rounds.</p><p>You can target a creature with more hit points than this spell could normally affect, causing it to become dazed for 1 round.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (6th)</h>: If you expend three uses of mythic power, the magic of the word lingers around the target. Until the beginning of your next turn, if the target's hit points are reduced enough to put it in a lower category for the spell's effects, the spell affects the creature according to its new hit point total. For example, a creature in the 101-150 hp category reduced to 80 hp is immediately stunned for an additional 1d4 rounds. The spell's effects don't diminish if the target regains hit points.</p>
Pox Pustules	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The Dexterity penalty increases to -6. The target takes 1 point of bleed damage each round. If the target spends a move action scratching, increase its bleed damage each round by 1. If the bleeding is stopped, scratching causes it to start again at 1 point of bleed per round.</p>
Prayer	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The spell's luck bonus increases to +2, and the penalty for enemies changes to -2. When you cast the spell, your affected allies heal an amount of hit point damage equal to double your tier, and affected enemies take an amount of damage equal to double your tier.</p>
Prismatic Sphere	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>When you cast the spell, you simultaneously create a <i>prismatic spray</i> that originates from one point on the sphere and radiates directly away from you. The save DC of this <i>prismatic spray</i> is the same as that of your <i>mythic prismatic sphere</i>.</p>
Prismatic Spray	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The spell automatically blinds creatures with up to 12 Hit Dice instead of 8 Hit Dice. Attempt one bull rush combat maneuver and apply its results to each creature in the area. Your CMB for this bull rush is equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. This bull rush doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (6th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the area changes from a cone into a line. Creatures in the line are struck by two beams (or three, if the creature rolls an 8 on the table). The spell bypasses energy resistance and immunity.</p>
Protection from Chaos	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>As <i>mythic protection from evil</i>, except against chaotic creatures.</p>
Protection from Evil	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The bonuses to AC and on saves increase to +4. Any evil creature attempting to possess or exercise mental control over the target must attempt a Will save against this spell. If it fails, the creature takes 1d6 points of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d6) from mental feedback. An evil creature that uses spell resistance to bypass the spell's protection against contact must successfully save or take this damage once each round it attacks the protected target.</p>

Protection from Chaos	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>As <i>mythic protection from evil</i>, except against chaotic creatures.</p>
Protection from Evil	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The bonuses to AC and on saves increase to +4.

Protection from Law	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>As <i>mythic protection from evil</i></p>
Protection from Arrows	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage reduction increases to 15/magic. The maximum damage prevented by the spell increases to 15 points per caster level (maximum 150 points). If the spell prevents all damage from a ranged weapon attack, it turns the projectile or weapon back on the attacker, using the same attack roll result. If the attacker is also protected by <i>mythic protection from arrows</i> and its spell completely prevents the damage from the rebounded attack, the weapon or projectile is destroyed.</p>
Ray of Enfeeblement	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The Strength penalty increases to 1d8 + 1 per 2 caster levels (maximum +10). If the target fails its save, it's fatigued.</p>
Reduce Person	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>You can decrease the target's size by up to two categories, to a minimum of Tiny. If the target shrinks two sizes, its weight decreases by a factor of 16 and it gains a +4 size bonus to Dexterity, a -4 size penalty to Strength, and a +2 bonus on attack rolls and to AC because of its decreased size. A Medium or Small humanoid creature whose size decreases to Tiny has a space of 2-1/2 feet and a natural reach of 0 feet.</p><p><i>Mythic reduce person</i> counters and dispels <i>mythic enlarge person</i>.</p>
Regenerate	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The casting time changes to 1 standard action and the target changes to 1 living creature or corpse touched. The spell removes the blinded, dazzled, and deafened conditions. The target gains regeneration equal to your tier (overcome by acid and fire) for 1 round per caster level. If the target was killed by amputation or decapitation (such as from a <i>vorpal</i> weapon) within the past 1 round, the spell regenerates lost body parts and brings the creature back to life (as <i>breath of life</i>), treating it as if it had negative hp equal to its Constitution score.</p>
Repel Wood	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The casting time changes to 1 immediate action. You may cause one affected wooden object up to 5 inches in diameter to splinter and break.</p><h>Mythic Augmented (3rd)</h><p>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the area changes to a 60-foot, cone-shaped emanation from you.</p>
Resist Energy	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The target gains a +4 bonus on saves against effects that deal damage of the selected energy type. Once each round as a free action, the target can choose one adjacent ally to gain energy resistance 5 against the chosen energy type for 1 round. This increases to energy resistance 10 at caster level 7 and energy resistance 15 at caster level 11.</p>
Resonating Word	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage dealt increases to 8d6 points on the 1st and 2nd rounds and 15d6 on the 3rd round. The target takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against all sonic effects.</p>
Reverse Gravity	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Creatures in the area or that enter the area must succeed at a Fortitude save or be nauseated.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (8th)</h>: If you expend three uses of mythic power, once per round as a move action you may select one secured creature (one that succeeded at its Reflex save) or attached object (such as a tree or cottage) and force it to attempt a Fortitude save against the spell. The selected creature or object can weigh no more than 100 pounds per caster level. If it fails the save, it's pulled free and falls upward.</p>
Ricochet Shot	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>If the attack hits the secondary target, the wielder can select a tertiary target within 20 feet of the secondary target. This functions like a ricochet off the primary target. The tertiary target must be a different creature than the primary target.</p><h>Mythic Augmented (3rd)</h><p>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the secondary and tertiary attacks gain the enhancement bonus and magic qualities of the attack against the primary target.</p>
Sacred Bond	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The range at which you and the target can cast conjuration (healing) spells on each other increases to medium (100 feet + 10 feet per caster level). When you or the target uses the <i>sacred bond</i> to cast a healing spell on the other, the caster also heals a number of hit points equal to the minimum amount the spell can heal.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (6th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, casting a healing spell through the link heals the caster the normal amount instead of the minimum amount.</p><p>You and the target can use the link to heal each other with targeted healing abilities such as lay on hands. Unlike with healing spells, a character using a healing ability in this way doesn't heal herself.</p>
Sanctify Armor	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>You gain DR 5/evil while wearing the target armor. While you're using your judgment or smite ability, this improves to DR 10/evil.</p><h>Mythic Augmented (3rd)</h><p>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, when you use judgment or smite, add half your tier to your AC as a sacred bonus.</p>
Sanctuary	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>If an attacker succeeds at its Will save to attack the protected target, add your tier to the target's AC against the attack. If the target uses a healing spell or ability on another creature, that creature gains the benefit of non-mythic <i>sanctuary</i> for 1 round. If the creature breaks the non-mythic <i>sanctuary</i> by attacking, subsequent healing by the target doesn't create another non-mythic <i>sanctuary</i> effect on the creature.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (2nd)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, select a number of additional creatures equal to half your tier that are within reach. These creatures gain the benefit of non-mythic <i>sanctuary</i>.</p>
Sands of Time	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>You age the target by two categories instead of one. The damage dealt to objects, constructs, and undead increases to 5d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20).</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (8th)</h>: If you expend four uses of mythic power, the duration changes to instantaneous. If the target is a living creature, its age increases to venerable, regardless of its current age. A non-mythic creature receives no saving throw against this, but a mythic creature can attempt a Fortitude save against the spell's DC to reduce the duration to 10 minutes per level and the effect to two age categories instead of automatically changing to venerable.</p><p>If the target is an object, construct, or undead, it takes 30 points of damage per caster level. A mythic creature that succeeds at a Fortitude takes only half damage.</p>
Saving Finale	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Add your tier as a bonus on the saving throw reroll.</p>
Scorching Ash Form	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage dealt increases to 3d6 points of fire damage. This otherwise makes the same changes as <i>mythic gaseous form</i>.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target can shift into or out of <i>scorching ash form</i> as a move action.</p>
Scorching Ray	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Each ray's damage increases to 6d6 points of fire damage. The first ray bypasses fire resistance and immunity.</p>
Scouring Winds	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The spell's damage increases to 4d8 points of piercing damage. Any creature in the area at the start of your turn must succeed at a Reflex save or be blinded for as long as it remains in the area and for 1d4 rounds after it leaves.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (5th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the sandstorm's radius and height each increase to 40 feet, and the damage dealt increases to 6d8 points of piercing damage. Each round, you can either move the storm up to 50 feet as a move action or up to 10 feet as a swift action.</p>
Searing Light	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The spell's damage increases to 1d6 per caster level (maximum 10d6). The damage dealt to an undead creature increases to 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d8), or 2d6 per caster level (maximum 20d6) if the undead is vulnerable to bright light. The damage dealt to constructs increases to 1d8 points of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d8). If a creature struck has light sensitivity or light blindness, it takes the penalty from that weakness for 1 round after being struck by the light.</p>
Sending	"<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>You can contact a number of additional creatures equal to your tier. Each creature must receive the same message, and can communicate back only to you.</p><h>Mythic Augmented (3rd)</h><p>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can send the message to unfamiliar creatures (using the same number of creatures as non-augmented <i>mythic sending</i>). You must either describe the intended recipients in general or specific terms (such as ""orcs,"" ""the queen of this country,"" or ""left-handed half-elven males"") or specify restrictions such as range, creature type, and alignment (such as ""all good-aligned humanoids in the castle on the hill""). If a greater number of creatures meet your description than the maximum number you can send to, the closest ones to you receive the message.</p>"
Shadow Anchor	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Add your tier to the CMD of the shadow tether. A creature attempting to escape the shadow tether using planar travel or teleportation must succeed at a Will saving throw or be shunted to the Plane of Shadow instead of its intended destination, as if it had cast <i>shadow walk</i> (if the target could not reach the Shadow Plane from its current location using <i>shadow walk</i>, this aspect of the spell has no effect).</p>
Shadow Weapon	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Add your tier to your caster level when determining what enhancement bonus or weapon special abilities the weapon can have. The weapon deals half damage to creatures that disbelieve in it and to objects, instead of only 1 point.</p><p>You can spend a swift action to transform the weapon into a dull black metal ring on your finger, or to return it from its ring form to its weapon form in your hand.</p>
Shatter	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Add your tier to your caster level when determining the maximum object weight you can affect. When targeting a crystalline creature, the spell's damage increases to 1d8 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 10d8). You may damage a single magical object as if it were a crystalline creature. If the spell destroys an object or damages a crystalline creature, broken shards litter the spell area or creature's space and act as caltrops.</p>
Shield of Faith	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Add half your tier to the spell's deflection bonus.</p>
Shield Other	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Increase the range to long (400 feet + 40 feet per caster level). Subtract your tier from any damage transmitted to you through the mystical connection before applying the damage (minimum 1 hp of damage). When you use your surge ability to modify a saving throw against an effect that also affects your linked ally, the ally also applies your surge bonus die result to the ally's saving throw. If the ally also uses its own surge ability, it takes either your result or its result, whichever is higher.</p>
Shocking Grasp	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The spell's damage increases to 1d8 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 5d8). If the target is wearing metal armor or is made of metal, you may attempt a free grapple combat maneuver against the target.</p><p>Alternatively, if the target is carrying a metal weapon, you may attempt a free disarm combat maneuver against that weapon. This free combat maneuver doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power and the free grapple or disarm combat maneuver is successful, the target is staggered until your next turn. This is an electricity effect.</p>
Shout	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The duration that creatures in the area are deafened increases to 4d6 rounds, and the damage dealt increases to 5d8 points of sonic damage. The damage dealt to crystalline creatures and exposed brittle or crystalline objects increases to 1d8 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 15d8). Crystalline creatures reverberate with sonic energy, taking 4 points of sonic damage on your turn for a number of rounds equal to your tier.</p>
Silence	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>This spell also applies to telepathy, cutting off any mental communication within the area. At the time of casting, you can choose to be immune to your own <i>mythic silence</i> effect and can designate up to one creature per tier to also gain this immunity. Creatures immune to the <i>mythic silence</i> are subject to sonic effects as normal.</p>
Silent Image	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The duration increases to concentration + 1 round per caster level, and the effect increases to a visual figment that can't extend beyond eight 10-foot cubes + 1 10-foot cube per caster level.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (6th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the duration changes to concentration + 1 minute per caster level and the effect changes to a visual figment no larger than a 50-foot emanation. An augmented <i>mythic silent image</i> can't move.</p>
Sleep	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The spell affects up to 8 Hit Dice of creatures, and you can choose the order in which creatures are affected by the spell. Any effect that would automatically awaken a sleeping creature instead allows it to attempt a new Will saving throw to awaken.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (8th)</h>: If you expend three uses of mythic power, you can target all living creatures other than you that have 8 Hit Dice or fewer in a 1-mile radius centered on you. Creatures that fail their saving throws fall asleep for a number of days equal to your tier. You can select a number of creatures up to your tier to not be affected by the spell.</p>
Slow	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The penalty on attack rolls, on Reflex saves, and to AC increases to -2, and affected creatures move at one-fourth speed. Select one affected creature; this creature is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC.</p>
Solid Fog	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The penalty on melee attack and damage rolls increases to -4. The cloud's radius and height both increase to 50 feet.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented</h>: The augmented version of <i>mythic solid fog</i> has the same additional benefits as the augmented version of <i>mythic fog cloud</i>.</p>
Spider Climb	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The target gains a climb speed equal to its base land speed or 30 feet, whichever is higher. The target can take the run action while climbing and needs only one hand free to climb.</p><p>The target can move freely across spider webs (including giant spider webs), <i>web</i> spells, and similar adhesives of 2nd level or less (including tanglefoot bags) as if it were using <i>freedom of movement</i>.</p>
Spike Stones	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage dealt increases to 2d6 points of piercing damage plus 1 point of bleed damage. Add your tier to the DC to detect the magical trap.</p>
Spiritual Weapon	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The weapon gains your choice of one of the following magic weapon special abilities: <i>flaming</i>, <i>frost</i>, <i>keen</i>, <i>merciful</i>, <i>shock</i>, or <i>thundering</i>. Before or after the weapon attempts all of its attacks for the round, you can redirect it to a different target as a swift action instead of a move action.</p>
Stinking Cloud	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Creatures that succeed at their saves are sickened while they remain in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after they leave. Creatures that fail their saves continue to be sickened for 1 hour after leaving the cloud.</p>
Stone Shape	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The duration changes to 1 round/level and instantaneous (see text). Each round after the round you cast the spell, you can spend a standard action to shape up to 5 additional cubic feet of stone you touch. Shaped stone has an instantaneous duration (meaning it does not revert to its previous form when the spell ends).</p>
Stoneskin	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The target gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against disease, poison, and stun effects. There is a 50% chance any critical hit or sneak attack against the target is treated as a normal hit, as if the target were wearing <i>medium fortification</i> armor.</p>
Storm of Vengeance	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The acid damage dealt increases to 1d8 points of acid damage. The lightning damage dealt increases to 10d8 points of electricity damage. You can call down a bolt of lightning on the 2nd and 4th rounds (equivalent to those on the 3rd round). You can strike the same target with a bolt more than once during the casting of the spell, but not more than once per round.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (7th)</h>: If you expend three uses of mythic power, the storm cloud's radius increases to 1,000 feet. Structures in the storm take 1d10 points of damage per round (this damage bypasses hardness). You can call down one additional bolt in the 2nd and 4th rounds, and three additional bolts in the 3rd round.</p>
Strangling Hair	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>You may use your hair to attempt dirty trick, disarm, steal, or trip combat maneuvers instead of grapple combat maneuvers. Add your tier to combat maneuver checks attempted with your hair and to your hair's damage rolls made as part of a grapple.</p>
Suggestion	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p><i>Mythic suggestion</i> loses the language-dependent descriptor, and can target one or more living creatures in a 10-foot-radius burst.</p>
Summon Swarm	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The swarm has the advanced simple template. A swarm of rats or spiders leaves behind a trail of filth or ichor when it moves, which has the effects of a <i>grease</i> spell for 1 round after the swarm passes through an area. Any creature that moves through the affected area is also subject to the swarm's disease or poison, as if attacked by the swarm. A prone creature in the affected area takes a -4 penalty on its saving throw against this affliction. A bat swarm leaves behind a similar trail that lasts for 2 rounds but doesn't have a disease or poison effect.</p>
Sunbeam	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>You call forth one beam per 2 caster levels instead of per 3. The damage dealt increases to 4d8 points of damage. The damage dealt to undead creatures, fungi, mold, oozes, and slimes increases to 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d8). Any creature that successfully saves against a beam is dazzled for 1 minute.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (9th)</h>: If you expend three uses of mythic power, the first beam you create has a duration of 1 round per 2 caster levels, and deals maximum damage on the round you cast it. Creatures in the beam can attempt saving throws to avoid blindness, but not the spell's damage.</p>
Sun Metal	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The additional damage dealt by the weapon increases to 1d6 points of fire damage. Any creature struck by the weapon is dazzled for 1 round (no saving throw). On a critical hit, the target is blinded for 1 round (Fortitude negates, DC equal to the DC of the spell).</p>
Surmount Affliction	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>You can cast this spell with no verbal or somatic component, and even if you're helpless (but not unconscious). You temporarily overcome a number of additional harmful conditions equal to half your tier.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (7th)</h>: If you expend three uses of mythic power, you become immune to all afflictions the spell can normally overcome. In addition, you overcome (but do not become immune to) one of the following conditions: exhausted, nauseated, panicked, petrified, staggered, and stunned.</p>
Telekinesis	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The duration of this spell changes to 1 round per level. You may spend a move action to use the sustained force or combat maneuver effects of the spell.</p><p>When using sustained force, you can move a number of objects up to your tier. These must be in the same square and together must weigh no more than the weight limit of the spell.</p><p>Using the violent thrust effect ends the spell, but the weight restriction increases to 50 pounds per caster level (maximum 750 pounds).</p>
Theft Ward	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Add your tier to the Perception check bonus. Add your tier to your CMD against disarm and steal combat maneuvers attempted against the item.</p>
Time Stop	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Select a number of creatures equal to half your tier or fewer within close range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels). <i>Mythic time stop</i> has the same effect on these creatures as it does on you, allowing them to act for the same number of rounds of apparent time that you can. You and these creatures can all interact with one another normally while time appears to be stopped.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (10th)</h>: If you expend three uses of mythic power, the duration increases to 1 hour per level of apparent time. You and other affected creatures gain no benefit from rest or sleep while the spell is active.</p>
Touch Injection	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Add half your tier to the DC of a poison or potion you inject into another creature with this spell. If you do this with a substance that grants a skill bonus, add your tier to that skill bonus.</p>
Transformation	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>You can still cast spells and use spell completion and spell trigger items, but the level of the spell you're casting or using must be equal to or less than your tier. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your caster level.</p>
True Form	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The spell's target changes to up to one creature per 2 caster levels. If a target is a creature that has the ability to change shape between a specific set of forms (such as a barghest or lycanthrope), you may choose which form the creature takes. To force such a creature into a form, you must have either seen it in that form or succeeded at an appropriate Knowledge check to know the creature has the ability to take that form.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (6th)</h>: If you expend three uses of mythic power, the spell creates an area affecting all shapechanging creatures. The range changes to 30 feet and the spell affects all creatures in a 30-foot radius around you. Each creature must attempt a saving throw against the spell every round it remains in the area.</p>
True Strike	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The affected attack bypasses all damage reduction.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (2nd)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you gain a +10 insight bonus on your second attack that round and a +5 insight bonus on your third attack that round.

Tsunami	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The wave increases to 20 feet wide per caster level and 3 feet tall per caster level.

Vampiric Touch	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The spell's damage increases to 1d8 points of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 10d8). Your melee touch attack to deliver the spell threatens a critical hit on a 19 or 20. This expanded threat range doesn't stack with other effects or abilities that increase the threat range. If the damage kills the target, you gain fast healing 5 for a number of rounds equal to the Hit Dice of the target.</p>
Vomit Twin	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Any spell you cast that has a range of touch, close, medium, or long can originate from the twin instead of you. The twin gains a deflection bonus to AC equal to your tier, and has hit points equal to double your caster level. The twin can attempt attacks of opportunity using your base attack bonus, but has no ability score modifiers, skills, or feats. It threatens an area appropriate for your size and wields a copy of the weapon you were wielding when you cast <i>mythic vomit twin</i>. If the twin's weapon is destroyed or disarmed, on your turn the twin generates a new weapon from its own substance. Its attacks deal damage using that weapon's die type.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (5th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you create two copies when you cast the spell, and both can be active at the same time. If you instead expend three uses of mythic power, you create three copies when you cast the spell, and all three can be active at the same time.</p>
Walk through Space	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>You can teleport as either a move action or a swift action, but never more than once per round. If you expend a move action and a swift action, you may teleport up to 60 feet.</p>
Wall of Fire	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The wall's damage increases to 2d6 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet, 1d6 points of fire damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet, and 2d8 points of fire damage + 1 point of fire damage per caster level (maximum +20) to any creature passing through it. Any creature that passes through the wall or is within 5 feet of the wall when it's created must succeed at a Reflex save or catch fire. Attempts to extinguish this fire use the spell's save DC.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (5th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you may move the wall 5 feet in any direction as a move action on your turn. Moving the wall into a fireproof barrier (such as a stone wall) destroys the part of the wall that overlaps the barrier.</p>
Wall of Force	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The wall's hardness increases to 40, and its hit points increase to 30 per caster level. A non-mythic <i>disintegrate</i> spell or <i>rod of cancellation</i> negates a 10-foot-square section of a <i>mythic wall of force</i> for 1 round, after which the wall reforms at full strength. One side of the wall (chosen by you) repels creatures within 5 feet as a <i>repulsion</i> spell (using the DC <i>wall of force</i> would have if it allowed a saving throw).</p>
Wall of Ice	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The wall's hit points increase to 5 hit points per inch of thickness. Add your tier to the Strength check DC to break through the wall. The damage dealt to those that step through the wall increases to 1d8 points of cold damage + 1 point per caster level. Any creature that passes through the wall must succeed at a Fortitude save or be staggered for 1d4 rounds; this is a cold effect.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (5th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you cover the wall in sharp, protruding icicles. Any creature that touches, strikes, or breaks through the wall takes 1d6 points of cold damage, 1d6 points of piercing damage, and 1 point of bleed damage.</p>
Wall of Iron	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The wall is 1 inch thick per 2 caster levels. If you create an unattached wall, you can weight it so there is a 75% chance it falls on its own in the direction you want. Subtract 5 from the DC to push it in the direction you want, and add 5 to the DC to push the wall in the other direction.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (7th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, one side of the wall (your choice) has a powerful magnetic charge that attracts metal within 10 feet. The wall automatically attempts a combat maneuver check to pull once per round against any creature that comes in range wearing metal armor, wielding a metal weapon, or otherwise carrying a significant amount of metal.</p><p>The wall's CMB is equal to your caster level plus your tier. If the combat maneuver succeeds, the creature is pulled 5 feet closer to the wall. The wall gains a +5 bonus on its combat maneuver check if the creature is within 5 feet. If the wall succeeds at its check against a creature within 5 feet, the creature is pulled up against the wall and is treated as grappled.</p><p>Dropping metal items or removing metal armor allows a creature to free itself from the wall. The magnetic charge fades after 1 hour per tier. Wrenching an item away from the wall requires a successful Strength check (DC 10 + the wall's CMB).</p>
Wall of Stone	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The wall is 1 inch thick per 2 caster levels. The wall's hardness increases to 12.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (7th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the wall is impassable to ethereal travel and spells such as <i>passwall</i> and <i>phase door</i>. The wall is immune to non-mythic <i>disintegrate</i>, <i>shatter</i>, <i>sympathetic vibration</i>, and other non-mythic magical effects that specifically affect stone (including <i>earthquake</i>, <i>soften earth and stone</i>, and <i>transmute rock to mud</i>).</p>
Wall of Thorns	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage dealt increases to 30 minus the creature's AC. Any creature adjacent to the wall is automatically grappled by it. Any creature that begins its turn grappled by the wall takes 2d6 points of damage. Half of this damage is bludgeoning, and the other half is piercing. For the purpose of escaping this grapple, the wall's CMD is 10 + your caster level + your tier.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (6th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the wall automatically grapples creatures other than you within 10 feet. Any creature grappled by the wall takes 2d6 points of bleed damage. If a creature doesn't escape the wall's grapple, on its next turn the wall automatically pins it.</p>
Web	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The webs are filled with spider swarms (one spider swarm for each 10-foot-by-10-foot area covered in webs). Any creature caught in or moving through the webs is attacked by a spider swarm (or multiple swarms, if it passes through the space of more than one swarm). The spiders don't leave the area of webbing. Destroying the web in an area destroys the swarm there as well, and completely destroying the web destroys all the swarms.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (5th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the webs increase to a 50-foot-radius spread. Webs span any gaps between available anchor points in the area, possibly creating multiple non-contiguous webbed areas. Non-mythic abilities that make creatures immune to webs (such as <i>freedom of movement</i>) instead give them a +5 bonus on saves, combat maneuver checks, and Escape Artist checks against <i>mythic web</i>.</p>
Whirlwind	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The cyclone becomes 15 feet wide at the base, 40 feet wide at the top, and 40 feet tall. The cyclone's effect on Large or smaller creatures also applies to Huge creatures, and its damage increases to 3d8 points of damage. The effect on Medium or smaller creatures also applies to Large creatures, and the damage it deals each turn increases to 2d6 points of damage.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (8th)</h>: If you expend three uses of mythic power, the cyclone's size increases to 50 feet wide at the base, 150 feet wide at the top, and 150 feet tall. Creatures and objects of all sizes touched by the whirlwind take 8d8 points of damage (Reflex negates), and the damage dealt to those trapped in the cyclone increases to 6d6 points of damage per round. Additionally, unattended objects smaller than 30 feet to a side are swept up in the effect. The area within 20 feet of the whirlwind is treated as severe wind, and within 40 feet it is treated as strong wind.</p>
Wish	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>When using <i>mythic wish</i> to duplicate another spell, you can duplicate a mythic spell you know (if you're a spontaneous caster) or have prepared (if you're a caster who prepares spells). If you don't know or haven't prepared the mythic spell, you can expend a second use of mythic power to duplicate the mythic version of the desired spell.</p><p>You can also produce any one of the following effects that modify or replace effects listed in the non-mythic <i>wish</i> spell description:</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can cast a silent, stilled <i>mythic wish</i>, even if you're helpless or couldn't otherwise take actions (but not unconscious).</p>
Word of Chaos	<h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>When determining the spell's effect on non-mythic creatures, add your tier to your caster level. Non-chaotic creatures that fail their saves against the spell also take a -4 penalty on attack rolls and saving throws, and their spell resistance decreases by 5 for as long as the spell's other effects last.</p>
