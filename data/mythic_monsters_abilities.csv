dual-initiative	Dual Initiative (Ex)	"<p><b>Dual Initiative (Ex)</b>: The monster gets two turns each round, one on its initiative count and another on its initiative count â€“ 20. For example, if the monster's initiative is 23, for its first turn it could make a full attack (and take a 5 foot step) at initiative 23, and for its second turn at initiative 3 it could take a move action and cast a spell. This allows the monster to perform two actions per round that normally take an entire round, such as using a <i>summon monster</i> spell. For the purposes of spells and effects that have a duration of a round or longer or trigger at the beginning of the creature's round or the start of its turn such as saving throws against ongoing effects or taking bleed damage), only the monster's first turn each round counts toward such durations.<br/>

Each day, it can expend a number of uses of mythic power equal to its mythic rank. This amount is its maximum amount of mythic power.

It may have other abilities that rely on mythic power.<br/>

poisonous-blood	Poisonous Blood (Ex)	"<p><b>Poisonous Blood (Ex)</b>: Any creature that confirms a critical hit against the monster with a piercing or slashing melee weapon is sprayed with poison.

If this save succeeds, the effect affects the creature as if it had succeeded at its initial saving throw. If the effect already allows another saving throw on a later turn to break the effect (such as for <i>hold monster</i>), this ability is in addition to the extra saving throw from the effect.<br/>

If this reduces the remaining time that the creature can hold its breath to 0 rounds or fewer, the DCs of its suffocation checks increase by 5. For example, if the monster is grappling a creature that has 10 rounds remaining before it has to attempt suffocation checks, a successful grapple check reduces that duration by 1d6 rounds.If the monster has another ability (such as constrict) that harms the opponent when it succeeds at a grapple check, it can automatically use the smother ability when it succeeds at the grapple check to use the other ability.<br/>

The monster can use this ability even if it's mindless or of animal-level intelligence.</p>Surge doesn't have a separate entry in the monster stat block-the surge die is listed in the mythic power ability.
