You gain the ferocity monster special ability, a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d6 + your caster level (maximum +10), and a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. You cannot use the withdraw action or willingly move away from a creature that has attacked you.</p><p>When you use this spell, you immediately take 4 points of Intelligence damage.

Blinding Ray	Blinding Ray	evocation [good, light]	cleric 2, inquisitor 3, paladin 2	1 standard action 	V, S, DF	close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	one or more rays of light	instantaneous (see text)	Fortitude negates	yes 	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You blast your enemies with blinding rays of sunlight. You may fire one ray, plus one additional ray for every four levels beyond 3rd (to a maximum of three rays at 11th level). Each ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit. If a ray hits, it explodes into powerful motes of light, and the target must save or be blinded for 1 round. If the target has light blindness, light sensitivity, or is otherwise vulnerable to bright light, it instead must save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds and take 1d4 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d4).

Black Mark	Black Mark	necromancy [curse, fear]	druid 7, witch 7	1 standard action	V, S, M (a flask of seawater)	touch	one creature	permanent	Will negates	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You mark the target with a black marking on its skin; the mark's exact appearance determined by you, but can be no larger than your hand. The <i>black mark </i>functions as a <i>mark of justice</i>, and when the mark is activated, the target becomes shaken anytime it is on or in the water more than a 5 feet from shore. In addition, as long as the <i>black mark </i>is active, the target is affected as if subject to <i>nature's exile </i>, but all creatures with the aquatic or water subtype or with a swim speed are made hostile, even those not of the animal type, though non-aquatic animals are not. </p>
Blink	Blink	transmutation	bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3	1 standard action	V, S	personal	you	1 round/level (D)	none	none	"<h>Normal Use</h><p>You ""blink"" quickly back and forth between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane and look as though you're winking in and out of reality at random. <i>Blink </i>has several effects, as follows.</p><p>Physical attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn't help opponents, since you're ethereal and not merely invisible. If the attack is capable of striking ethereal creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for concealment).</p><p>If the attacker can see invisible creatures, the miss chance is also only 20%. (For an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures, there is no miss chance.) Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike.</p><p>Any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you're blinking unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. Your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane (but they might affect targets on the Ethereal Plane).</p><p>While blinking, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane). Although you are only partially visible, you are not considered invisible and targets retain their Dexterity bonus to AC against your attacks. You do receive a +2 bonus on attack rolls made against enemies that cannot see invisible creatures.</p><p>You take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.</p><p>While blinking, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled.</p><p>Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures. You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones.</p><p>An ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down. As an incorporeal creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures.</p><p>An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.</p><p>Force effects and abjurations affect you normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane. Treat other ethereal creatures and objects as material.</p>"

When you cast this spell, make an Intimidate check to demoralize each enemy within 30 feet of you. Enemies that are demoralized this way take 1d10 points of fire damage and must succeed at a Reflex save or catch fire. Spell resistance can negate the fire damage caused by this spell, but does not protect the creature from the demoralizing effect.</p>
Blood Crow Strike	Blood Crow Strike	evocation [fire]	cleric 4	1 round	V, S	medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	one creature	instantaneous	none	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>Your unarmed strikes release blasts of energy in the form of bolts of fire or glowing red crows, which fly instantaneously to strike your target. You can make unarmed strike or flurry of blows attacks against the target as if it were in your threatened area; each successful attack deals damage as if you had hit it with your unarmed strike, except half the damage is fire and half is negative energy (this negative energy does not heal undead). For example, if you are a 14th-level monk, you can use a flurry of blows to attack five times, creating one energy crow for each successful attack against the target, and dealing 2d6 points of damage (plus appropriate unarmed strike modifiers) with each crow.</p>
Call Animal	Call Animal	enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]	druid 1, ranger 1	1 standard action	V, S, DF	see description	one animal whose CR is equal or less than your caster level	1 hour/level (D)	none	none	<h>Normal Use</h><p>This spell calls the nearest wild animal of a particular type you designate (provided the animal's CR is equal to or less than your caster level) to seek you out. The animal moves toward you under its own power, so the time it takes to arrive depends on how close an animal of the desired type is when you cast the spell. If there is no animal of that type capable of reaching you within the spell's duration, you are aware of this fact, but the spell is wasted. Knowledge of the local fauna makes this spell more effective, and the GM may permit a Knowledge (nature) skill check (DC 15) to know what animals can be found in an area.</p><p>When the called animal arrives, it approaches to within 5 feet of you and remains nearby for the duration of the spell. Its starting attitude is indifferent, modified by circumstances and interaction. Other than starting attitude, this spell gives you no special influence or ability to communicate with the called animal, although you may use other spells or abilities to do so.</p><p>Once the spell's duration expires, the animal acts in accordance with its attitude. Most animals will likely wander off, but a hostile predatory animal may attack, especially if it is hungry or provoked.</p><p>Domesticated animals or animals trained by someone else, including such creatures as familiars or animal companions, are unaffected by <i>call animals</i>.</p>
Cape of Wasps	Cape of Wasps	conjuration (summoning)	druid 4, witch 4	1 standard action	V, S	personal	you	1 round/level (D)	none	none	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You summon a wasp swarm, which fills your space (up to 5 feet by 5 feet) but does not attack you. The dense cloud of vermin gives you partial concealment against ranged attacks. Any creature that makes a successful melee attack against you takes 2d6 points of swarm damage and poison from the wasp swarm, but is not affected by the swarm's distraction ability. As a free action on your turn, you may have the swarm cling to you tightly, giving you a fly speed of 20 feet (poor maneuverability); when using the swarm to fly, it does not provide concealment or harm creatures that strike you. You can return the swarm to its protective shape as a free action on your turn.</p>
Companion Mind Link	Companion Mind Link	enchantment (charm) [mind-affecting]	druid 3, ranger 3	1 standard action	V, S	close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	your animal companion	1 minute/level	none	none	<h>Normal Use</h><p>The link between you and your animal companion becomes stronger. As long as you are within line of sight of your animal companion, you can telepathically communicate with it as if you two shared a language. Also, as long as you are within line of sight of the animal companion, you can push your animal companion a swift action instead of a move action, and you do not need to succeed at Handle Animal checks to handle your animal companion. Such checks automatically succeed.</p>

The <i>contingency </i>spell and the companion spell are cast at the same time. The 10-minute casting time is the minimum total for both castings; if the companion spell has a casting time longer than 10 minutes, use that instead. You must pay any costs associated with the companion spell when you cast <i>contingency.</i></p><p>The spell to be brought into effect by the <i>contingency </i>must be one that affects your person and be of a spell level no higher than one-third your caster level (rounded down, maximum 6th level).</p><p>The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. In all cases, the <i>contingency </i>immediately brings into effect the companion spell, the latter being ""cast"" instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. If complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the whole spell combination (<i>contingency </i>and the companion magic) may fail when triggered. The companion spell occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether you want it to.</p><p>You can use only one <i>contingency </i>spell at a time; if a second is cast, the first one (if still active) is dispelled.</p>"
Cup of Dust	Cup of Dust	transmutation	druid 3, witch 3	1 standard action	V, S, M (a pinch of dust)	close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	one creature	1 day/level (D)	Fortitude negates	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You curse the target with a thirst no drink can quench. On a failed saving throw, the target begins to dehydrate. The effects of this spell cannot inflict more nonlethal damage than the target has hit points. No amount of drinking can counter this effect, although the target still experiences the other normal effects of any liquid imbibed (such as poisons or potions). <i>Cup of dust </i>can be removed with a <i>break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, </i>or <i>wish</i> spell, but effects suffered as a result of dehydration must be healed by normal means.</p>

The DC to resist negative channeled energy within this area gains a +3 profane bonus.

If that creature has a burrow, climb, fly, or swim speed, you gain that form of movement for the duration of the spell at the same speed and maneuverability as the selected creature. If this gives you the burrow or swim speed, you can breathe while burrowing or swimming. If the creature moves 1,000 feet or more from you, the spell ends. If the creature has more than one of these types of movement, you select one from the types available to the creature.</p>

On a failed saving throw, the target begins to starve. The effects of this spell cannot inflict more nonlethal damage than the target has hit points. No amount of eating can counter the effect and, further, even attempting to eat causes the target to become nauseated for 1 round unless they make a DC 12 Fortitude save. The target still experiences the other normal effects of anything consumed (such as poisons or potions). <i>Feast of ashes</i> can be removed with a <i>break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, </i>or <i>wish</i> spell, but effects suffered as a result of starvation must be healed by normal means.</p>

The flames also protect you from either cold-based or fire-based attacks, depending on if you choose cool or warm flames for your <i>fire shield</i>.</p><p>Any creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). This damage is either cold damage (if you choose a <i>chill shield</i>) or fire damage (if you choose a <i>warm shield</i>). If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect. Creatures wielding melee weapons with reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you.</p><p>When casting this spell, you appear to immolate yourself, but the flames are thin and wispy, increasing the light level within 10 feet by one step, up to normal light. The color of the flames is blue or green if the <i>chill shield </i>is cast, violet or red if the <i>warm shield </i>is employed. The special powers of each version are as follows.</p><p><i>Chill Shield</i>: The flames are cool to the touch. You take only half damage from fire-based attacks. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful saving throw.</p><p><i>Warm Shield</i>: The flames are warm to the touch. You take only half damage from cold-based attacks. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful saving throw.</p>

Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a successful Reflex save or fall. A creature can walk within or through the area of grease at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means it can't move that round (and must then make a Reflex save or fall), while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Acrobatics skill for details). Creatures that do not move on their turn do not need to make this check and are not considered flat-footed.</p><p>The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item. Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while an object wielded or employed by a creature requires its bearer to make a Reflex saving throw to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made in each round that the creature attempts to pick up or use the <i>greased </i>item. A creature wearing <i>greased </i>armor or clothing gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks made to escape a grapple, and to their CMD to avoid being grappled.</p>

You must succeed at a melee touch attack to strike the target.

Make an unarmed strike attack roll against the target as if it were in your threatened area. If the attack is successful, the rock deals bludgeoning damage to the target as if you had hit the target with your unarmed strike.

These images remain in your space and move with you, mimicking your movements, sounds, and actions exactly. Whenever you are attacked or are the target of a spell that requires an attack roll, there is a possibility that the attack targets one of your images instead. If the attack is a hit, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. If it is a figment, the figment is destroyed. If the attack misses by 5 or less, one of your figments is destroyed by the near miss. Area spells affect you normally and do not destroy any of your figments. Spells and effects that do not require an attack roll affect you normally and do not destroy any of your figments. Spells that require a touch attack are harmlessly discharged if used to destroy a figment.</p><p>An attacker must be able to see the figments to be fooled. If you are invisible or the attacker is blind, the spell has no effect (although the normal miss chances still apply).</p>

Moving farther than 5 feet from the tether point requires the target to make a bull rush combat maneuver check against a CMB of 10 + 1/2 your caster level + your Intelligence modifier (if a witch or wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a bard or sorcerer). The target takes a -1 penalty for every 5 feet of distance between it and its tethered square. Failing this check means the target's move is wasted and it cannot move farther away.

A creature cannot take a 5-foot-step while in <i>solid fog</i>. <i>Solid fog</i>, and effects that work like <i>solid fog</i>, do not stack with each other in terms of slowed movement and attack penalties.</p><p>Unlike normal fog, only a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these vapors, and it does so in 1 round.</p><p><i>Solid fog </i>can be made permanent with a <i>permanency </i>spell.

Normal and magical fire, cold, gas, and the like can still harm you. While the <i>time stop </i>is in effect, other creatures are invulnerable to your attacks and spells; you cannot target such creatures with any attack or spell. A spell that affects an area and has a duration longer than the remaining duration of the <i>time stop</i> have their normal effects on other creatures once the <i>time stop </i>ends. Most spellcasters use the additional time to improve their defenses, summon allies, or flee from combat.</p><p>You cannot move or harm items held, carried, or worn by a creature stuck in normal time, but you can affect any item that is not in another creature's possession.</p><p>You are undetectable while <i>time stop </i>lasts.

Against creatures affected by polymorph spell effects (such as <i>baleful polymorph</i> or <i>giant form</i>), you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect. Success means that the polymorph effect immediately ends.</p><p>A creature with the supernatural ability to change shape (such as a lycanthrope) must make a Will saving throw or immediately revert to its true form. If it fails this first saving throw, the creature can attempt another Will saving throw to overcome the spell as a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If this save succeeds, the spell ends and the creature is capable of changing shape once again. If the second save fails, the creature is locked in its true form for the duration of the spell, preventing any further polymorph effects from changing its shape.</p>
