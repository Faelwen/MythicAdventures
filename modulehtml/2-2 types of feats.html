<h>Types of Feats</h>
<p>Many feats belong to a category that has special rules associated to it. This category is listed after the feat name. The following types of feats can be found in this section.</p>
<h>Metamagic Feats</h>
<p>Metamagic feats allow spellcasters to modify and change their spells, granting the spells new powers and effects. Such spells generally take up a higher-level spell slot than the normal spell.</p>
<h>Mythic Feats</h>
<p>Only characters with mythic tiers or creatures with mythic ranks can take these feats. If a creature becomes non-mythic, it no longer gains the benefit of these feats, but it doesn't lose them permanently. If the creature becomes mythic again, it regains the use of all the mythic feats it once had.</p>
<p>Many mythic feats enhance non-mythic feats with the same name. When a creature has a mythic version of a feat, that feat is denoted with a superscript "M" in the feat line of its stat block.</p>
