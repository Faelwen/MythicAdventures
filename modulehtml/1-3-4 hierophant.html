<h>Hierophant</h>
<p>Those who draw upon a god's power find themselves becoming closer to the divine. Some aspire to become immortal servants of their gods, and others reach for apotheosis itself. A hierophant could be either of these, channeling divine power directly or indirectly&#151;whether from a deity, the spirit of nature, or the power of life itself&#151;and eventually becoming more like a patron of divine power than a mere devotee.</p>
<p><b>Role</b>: As a hierophant, your role in the group is to act as a conduit to the divine, healing and helping your allies through the miracles that you bestow. This focus is just as strong if you are instead a servant of nature, using the powers granted to you by this path to protect the wilderness and bring its fury to those who would dare to defile it.</p>
<p><b>Classes</b>: Members of any class that draws upon divine magic will find the path of the hierophant useful&#151;particularly clerics, druids, and oracles. Even classes with limited divine spellcasting, such as the inquisitor and paladin, have a number of useful options in this path.</p>
<p><b>Bonus Hit Points</b>: Whenever you gain a hierophant tier, you gain 4 bonus hit points. These hit points stack with themselves, and don't affect your overall Hit Dice or other statistics.</p>

<h>Hierophant Features</h>
<p>As you gain tiers, you gain the following abilities.</p>
<p><b>Divine Surge</b>: Select one of the following abilities. Once chosen, it can't be changed.</p>

<p><b>Path Ability</b>: At 1st tier and every tier thereafter, select one new path ability from the hierophant path abilities lists or from the universal path abilities lists. Once you select an ability, it can't be changed. Unless otherwise noted, each ability can be selected only once. Some abilities have requirements, such as a class ability or minimum mythic tier, that you must meet before you select them.</p>
<link class="referencefeat" recordname="lists.MythicHeroes.MythicPaths.Hierophant.Abilities.Divine-Vessel-Ex"><b>Divine Vessel (Ex)</b></link>
<p><b>Divine Vessel (Ex)</b>: At 10th tier, whenever you cast a spell that targets one or more non-mythic creatures, those creatures must roll twice for any saving throws associated with the spell and take the lower result. Whenever you are healed of hit point damage by a spell or effect, you are healed for the maximum possible amount. You also gain DR 10/epic. Once per round when you take more than 20 points of damage (after damage reduction is applied), you regain one use of mythic power.</p>
