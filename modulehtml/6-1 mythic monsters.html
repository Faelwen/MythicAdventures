<h>Mythic Monsters</h>
<p>Just as mythic heroes can call upon power beyond reckoning, mythic monsters are greater than others of their kind. Some are empowered by deities or great magic and sent into the world to sow ruin and reap destruction. Others are instead relics of a bygone age when the power of creation itself flowed through the veins of every living being. Though not necessarily malevolent, these ancient creatures are a force to be respected and feared.</p>
<p>The rules in <i>Mythic Adventures</i> assume monsters that wield mythic power are rare in the world. Such creatures fall into one of two categories: powerful versions of existing monsters and entirely new breeds of monsters. You can easily create the first type of monster by using one of the mythic simple templates presented in this section. Creating the second type of monster is more complicated, and requires adding the mythic subtype and custom abilities appropriate to the creature, with more powerful monsters gaining more abilities than weaker monsters.</p>
<p>This section includes over 40 example creatures&#151;mythic versions of cyclopes, demons, dragons, elementals, giants, medusas, and other creatures of legend&#151;each of which represents an ancient predecessor or powerful evolution of the non-mythic version.</p>
<p>This section continues with information on the mythic simple templates and mythic subtype, advice on how to create and balance new mythic monsters, and several new universal monster rules used by the monsters in <i>Mythic Adventures</i>.</p>
