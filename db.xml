<p><i>Mythic Adventures</i> uses several terms that are new to the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, or that previously existed but were rarely used. These terms are worth reviewing before continuing on with the contents in this section.</p>

<p><b>Ascension</b>: The moment of ascension is the moment when a normal character becomes a mythic character. This event is usually a critical moment in the story that helps to define the mythic character's origin and the source of her power. Once a character has undergone ascension, she gains her first mythic tier and can select a mythic path.</p>

<p><b>Boon</b>: When a mythic character completes a particularly difficult task, the GM might reward that character with a boon. A boon represents having earned the favor of the source of the character's power. Once acquired, a boon allows the character to draw upon mythic power one additional time that day. A mythic character might be rewarded with a boon several times in a single session, but no more than once per encounter.</p>

<p><b>DR/Epic</b>: A type of damage reduction, DR/epic can be overcome only by a weapon with an enhancement bonus of +6 or greater. Weapons with special abilities also count as epic for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction if the total bonus value of all of their abilities (including the enhancement bonus) is +6 or greater.</p>

<p><b>Mythic</b>: With abilities seemingly beyond the those of ordinary mortals, a mythic character or mythic monster becomes part of a story that plays out on a greater scale than ordinary people can understand. An attack, spell, or other effect is considered mythic if it originates from a mythic source, such as a character or creature with a mythic tier or rank.</p>

<p><b>Mythic Path</b>: (Often referred to just as a "path.") The theme of a characters mythic abilities is determined by her mythic path&#151;archmage, champion, guardian, hierophant, marshal, or trickster. Each path has a number of special abilities associated with it that the character can select as she advances in tier.</p>

<p><b>Mythic Power</b>: Each mythic character can call upon this base mythic ability to influence destiny and fuel other abilities. At its most basic, mythic power is needed to use the surge ability, but it can also be called upon to use a number of other mythic abilities.</p>

<p><b>Mythic Rank</b>: (Often referred to just as a "rank.") Similar to tiers, mythic ranks are used to describe the approximate mythic power possessed by a monster. All creatures with a mythic rank are considered mythic for the purposes of feats, spells, magic items, and other abilities. Mythic ranks range from 1 to 10.</p>

<p><b>Mythic Tier</b>: (Often referred to just as a "tier.") Mythic characters advance in power by gaining tiers, each of which grants new abilities. Attaining a new mythic tier requires completing difficult trials within the campaign's story rather than accumulating experience points. Mythic tiers range from 1 to 10. Characters who achieve 10th tier are at the height of mythic power, and are in some respects akin to minor deities.</p>

<p><b>Mythic Trial</b>: (Often referred to just as a "trial.") A trial is a difficult task that awaits mythic heroes. It usually represents the culmination of part of the heroes' story, marking it as an important point in their legend. A mythic character has to complete one or more trials in order to reach a new mythic tier. Trials and mythic path advancement are separate from XP and character level advancement, and are based on grand achievements within the story rather than individual encounters.</p>

<p><b>Non-Mythic</b>: Any attack, spell, or effect originating from a character or creature without any mythic abilities is non-mythic. This term can also refer to a character without a mythic tier or a creature without a mythic rank.</p>

<p><b>Surge</b>: Surge is a basic ability that each mythic character receives. It allows her to roll a die and add the result to a d20 roll, influencing the outcome after the results are revealed.</p></text>

      <text type="formattedtext"><h>Mythic Heroes</h>
<p>Mythic heroes are set apart from their contemporaries, capable of amazing feats of courage in the face of overwhelming odds. In spite of this, they're still similar in many ways to other adventurers. They have hit points, an Armor Class, and saving throws&#151;in fact, most of their statistics are comparable to non-mythic characters of an equal level. Where mythic characters differ is in the special abilities they gain from mythic paths&#151;collections of similar abilities that they can choose to represent their mythic power. These abilities enhance mythic characters both in and out of battle, allowing them to take part in extraordinary, larger-than-life adventures.</p>

        <name type="string">Creating a Mythic Character</name>
        <text type="formattedtext"><h>Creating a Mythic Character</h>
<p>Unlike normal characters, those with mythic power have greater ties to the world around them and a greater place in legend. A skilled fighter might impact the history of a region, but a mythic champion can change its fate, and his every move is chronicled and recorded. Because of this greater impact on the campaign world, creating a mythic character requires you to work with the GM to find your place in the story and determine the source of your power.</p>
<p>To create a mythic character, start by creating a normal character using the standard rules found in the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>. Despite their incredible abilities, mythic characters start with the same class features and abilities as normal ones.</p>
<p>The process by which your character becomes mythic is determined by the shape of the overall campaign. Generally, characters become mythic in one of two ways&#151;either the GM decides to make the characters mythic as one part of the campaign, or their ascension and subsequent deeds are the central focus of the story from nearly the very beginning. Whichever path is chosen influences how you create your mythic character.</p>
<p>If mythic power is added to your character as part of a larger campaign (possibly only for a short period of time), that story defines the source of your newfound power, which is likely the same for all of the PCs. While you might not make all of the decisions about that power's origins and nature, you will still be able to customize your character by selecting your mythic path and abilities.</p>
<p>If mythic power will instead be a central theme of the entire campaign, each PC might have a different, individual source of power. In such a campaign, you should work with your GM to determine the source of your mythic power. This could be anything from contact with an ancient artifact to gaining the sponsorship of a deity. The GM might ask for all of the PCs to share some aspects of their power&#151;such as its source&#151;to give them a common bond, or you might come together as part of a larger destiny, a gathering of great heroes to accomplish truly legendary deeds.</p>
<p>In either case, there will be a moment in the campaign when you gain mythic power (or when it manifests, in the case of mythic power that has been latent in you since birth). This critical part of the story is called the moment of ascension. Depending on the style of the campaign, this could occur very early in the story or much later in your character's career, as part of larger plotline. From this moment onward, your character is mythic, and gains a mythic path and a variety of mythic abilities.</p>
<h>Mythic Ascension</h>
<p>The moment a character gains her first mythic tier is called the moment of ascension (or simply ascension) and is usually concurrent with an extraordinary event. Generally speaking, the GM determines this event, which has many implications on the story of the character. Ascension determines the source of a mythic character's power, and though this doesn't affect the types of abilities she gains, it can influence future choices and roleplaying decisions.</p>
<p>The GM is free to invent any sort of event to serve as the moment of ascension, as required by the needs of the campaign. Running a Mythic Game includes more information for GMs to consider when designing the moment of ascension. The following ideas represent some of the most common means of ascension.</p>
<p><i>Artifact</i>: The character comes into contact with an unstable artifact that unleashes some of its power into her, granting her mythic power. The mythic character might need to protect the artifact, as it is the source of her power.</p>
<p><i>Fated</i>: The character was born under an auspicious sign, such as a planetary conjunction or lunar eclipse, and as such was destined to greatness. The moment of ascension comes when those circumstances repeat themselves and the character gains mythic power.</p>
<p><i>Godling</i>: The mythic character is the child of a god, typically born from the union of that deity and a mortal. The moment of ascension is when the character learns of her true heritage or is visited by her divine parent (or an agent of that deity).</p>
<p><i>Granted</i>: A divine agent or other incredibly powerful being calls upon the character to act as its representative. This role gives the character mythic power, but possibly only while serving the interests of this benefactor and while holding to that patron's tenets.</p>
<p><i>Passed On</i>: The character is present at the death of a powerful&#151;perhaps even mythic&#151;creature. In its final moments, it passes on its power to the character, granting mythic abilities. Alternatively, its power might not be given voluntarily, but rather taken by the PCs when they slaying a mythic creature. These methods could even be the way that all mythic power is gained in a campaign.</p>
<h>Selecting a Path</h>
<p>Once you gain mythic power, you select a mythic path, which is much like an additional class. It determines the majority of your mythic abilities. But instead of gaining levels in a mythic path, you gain tiers that grant additional abilities and bonuses. Gaining a tier in a path doesn't replace gaining experience and character levels. You still receive experience points for defeating challenges, but these apply only to your class levels. You gain additional mythic tiers by completing a number of trials; see Gaining Tiers.</p>
<p>Each path grants a number of specific abilities. In addition, all mythic characters have certain mythic abilities in common (see the Base Mythic Abilities table). As soon as your mythic character achieves a new tier, you must select all of the new powers that come with that tier.</p></text>
      </CreatingAMythicCharacter>
      <MythicPaths>
        <name type="string">Mythic Paths</name>
        <text type="formattedtext"><h>Mythic Paths</h>
<p>Every mythic character belongs to a mythic path. Each path represents a journey into legend, and each tier in that path grants abilities and features related to that pursuit. Upon achieving his 1st mythic tier, a character must choose one mythic path to follow. Characters can choose from the following mythic paths.</p>
<p><link class="referencetext" recordname="lists.MythicHeroes.MythicPaths.Archmage"><b>Archmage</b></link>: A master of arcane magic, the archmage casts powerful spells with great skill and ease, and shapes reality at whim. The powers of the archmage allow her to alter her spells, penetrate foes' defenses, and master nearly any subject. While many of the archmage's abilities are most valuable to a character with a high Intelligence score, those with high Charisma scores will also find a wide variety of powerful options. The path of the archmage is suitable for arcane spellcasters.</p>
<p><link class="referencetext" recordname="lists.MythicHeroes.MythicPaths.Champion"><b>Champion</b></link>: Unparalleled in combat, the champion stands triumphant on the battlefield, surrounded by bruised and broken foes. The abilities of the champion allow him to deliver strikes more accurately, perform astounding combat maneuvers, and move effortlessly around the battlefield. Characters with a high Strength score will find this path extremely useful, as will those with a high Constitution score. The path of the champion is suitable for characters who rely on martial arms and combat maneuvers.</p>
<p><link class="referencetext" recordname="lists.MythicHeroes.MythicPaths.Guardian"><b>Guardian</b></link>: None can get past the impervious guardian&#151;those who threaten this devout hero's charges are doomed to fail. The powers of the guardian allow her to hold her ground, protect her allies, prevent enemies from moving past her, and survive hits that would defeat lesser heroes. Characters that have a high Constitution score and frequently find themselves in the middle of combat gain valuable powers by becoming a guardian. The path of the guardian is suitable for those who routinely sustain massive amounts of damage.</p>
<p><link class="referencetext" recordname="lists.MythicHeroes.MythicPaths.Hierophant"><b>Hierophant</b></link>: Drawing on power that goes beyond the gods, the hierophant is an inviolate vessel for the divine. The abilities of the hierophant allow him to enhance the power of his spells, heal others with greater potency, and commune with the gods. Most characters that become hierophants have a high Wisdom score, although many also have an above-average Charisma score. The path of the hierophant is suitable for divine spellcasters.</p>
<p><link class="referencetext" recordname="lists.MythicHeroes.MythicPaths.Marshal"><b>Marshal</b></link>: Inspiration and courage make the marshal the greatest leader, capable of leading troops to victory over any challenge. The powers of the marshal allow her to inspire others, which grants bonuses and additional opportunities to all of her comrades. Characters with a high Charisma score and an above-average Intelligence score will gain a variety of useful abilities by becoming marshals. The path of the marshal is suitable for those who continually aid others.</p>
<p><link class="referencetext" recordname="lists.MythicHeroes.MythicPaths.Trickster"><b>Trickster</b></link>: Skill, training, and savvy make the trickster the master of the impossible&#151;defying unbeatable obstacles and traps, tricking the wise, and hitting otherwise unattainable targets. The trickster's abilities allow him to change his appearance, manipulate others, and strike with deadly accuracy. Characters with high Dexterity and Charisma scores have a lot to gain from becoming tricksters. The path of the trickster is suitable for those who rely on subterfuge and cunning.</p></text>
        <Archmage>
          <name type="string">Archmage</name>
          <text type="formattedtext"><h>Archmage</h>
<p>For most practitioners of the arcane arts, learning magic requires a great deal of study and practice. Even for those who draw magic from their blood, the effort can be taxing. Not so for the archmage. This master of the arcane draws power from the very fabric of reality itself, learning to weave magic easily and naturally.</p>
<p>The archmage is the master of arcane magic, and many of the abilities of this path enhance your ability to cast arcane spells or greatly increase their potency. In addition, may of the options in this path increase your knowledge of magic and of those who wield it. At the highest tiers, you can begin to break down the walls between the different types of magic and alter the very fabric of reality itself.</p>
<p><b>Role</b>: As an archmage, you use your abilities to add a great deal of power to your arcane spells, enabling them to blast through defenses and cripple foes. Your mastery over the arcane arts and your vast knowledge are of great benefit to the rest of your group, and your talent at getting the most out of magic items can prove invaluable. Although you gain little in the way of defenses, your overwhelming offensive capabilities more than make up for it&#151;though you should still avoid being engaged in melee.</p>
<p><b>Classes</b>: The archmage is the most common path selection for characters capable of casting arcane spells, particularly sorcerers and wizards. Bards, summoners, and witches will find that this path has a great deal to offer, though some other paths might also prove useful to them.</p>
<p><b>Bonus Hit Points</b>: Whenever you gain an archmage tier, you gain 3 bonus hit points. These hit points stack with themselves, and don't affect your overall Hit Dice or other statistics.</p>

<h>Archmage Builds</h>
<p>When selecting your archmage's path abilities, you may wish to consider the following themes. Each suggests complementary path abilities, with different interpretations of what it means to be mythic master of the arcane.</p>
<p>Archmages may wish to take the mythic spellcasting universal path ability.</p>
<p><b>Arcane Power</b>: This theme focuses entirely on being an arcane powerhouse, thereby getting the most out of your spells. <i>1st-Tier Path Abilities</i>&#151;abundant casting, arcane endurance, eldritch breach, energy conversion, resilient arcana; <i>3rd-Tier Abilities</i>&#151;arcane metamastery, arcane potency, mythic spellpower; <i>6th-Tier Abilities</i>&#151;channel power, eldritch reciprocation.</p>
<p><b>Defensive Caster</b>: Spellcasters who take this route focus on abilities that protect them and those that counter the spells of others. <i>1st-Tier Path Abilities</i>&#151;competent caster, enduring armor, flexible counterspell, spellbane counterstrike; <i>3rd-Tier Abilities</i>&#151;eldritch flight, mirror dodge, spell sieve; <i>6th-Tier Abilities</i>&#151;eldritch reciprocation.</p>
<p><b>Knowledge Master</b>: Characters seeking to master nearly any subject (and some unknown) should consider the abilities of this theme. <i>1st-Tier Path Abilities</i>&#151;deep understanding, flash of omniscience, sensory link; <i>3rd-Tier Abilities</i>&#151;reverse scrying; <i>6th-Tier Abilities</i>&#151;divine knowledge, sanctum.</p>
<p><b>Prepared Archmage</b>: Arcane spellcasters who prepare their spells should consider the abilities of this theme. <i>1st-Tier Path Abilities</i>&#151;flexible school, greater familiar link, harmonious mage, mythic school, perfect preparation, rapid preparation; <i>3rd-Tier Abilities</i>&#151;arcane metamastery, arcane potency; <i>6th-Tier Abilities</i>&#151;divine knowledge.</p>

              <type type="string">Archmage Ability</type>
              <text type="formattedtext"><p>As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to cast any one arcane spell without expending a prepared spell or spell slot. If you prepare spells, this spell must be one you prepared today (even if you have already cast it); if you're a spontaneous caster, this spell must be one of your spells known. If the spell requires a saving throw, any non-mythic creatures affected by the spell roll twice and take the lower result.

During that time, the illusion gains all the physical properties of the depicted illusory object. You must touch the illusion to use this ability, and the object can be no larger than 5 cubic feet per tier. For example, if you create an illusory stone door, you transform it into an actual nonmagical stone door.</p></benefit>

          <text type="formattedtext"><h>Champion</h>
<p>The champion is the pinnacle of skill at arms and armor. No ordinary fighter could hope to match the skill with a blade, a bow, or an axe that surges within a mythic champion. The champion turns aside blows and shatters shields with every movement, all while racing gracefully across the chaotic battlefield. When the screams of fallen foes die down, the champion stands strong and defiant in blood-spattered armor, hefting a weapon and shouting a terrifying war cry.</p>
<p><b>Role</b>: As a champion, your role is to take the fight to your enemies. Using devastating melee powers, you can crush your enemies before they even have a chance to harm you and your allies. Few can match your skill at arms or your ability to perform amazing feats of strength. The champion abilities allow you to control your foes, move easily around the battlefield, and challenge a large number of foes all at once. The rest of the party can count on you to dominate any melee you charge into.</p>
<p><b>Classes</b>: While members or nearly any class could be champions, those who focus on melee attacks&#151; barbarians, cavaliers, fighters, monks, paladins, and rangers&#151;will find the abilities in this path most attractive and useful. However, even magi or rogues could find that the path of the champion is an excellent way to augment their abilities.</p>
<p><b>Bonus Hit Points</b>: Whenever you gain a champion tier, you gain 5 bonus hit points. These hit points stack with themselves, and don't affect your overall Hit Dice or other statistics.</p>

          <text type="formattedtext"><h>Guardian</h>
<p>Not all mythic characters seek glory and fame for themselves. Some take a more humble route, watching over those dear to them or the lands they call home. Guardians seek connections with those around them, even the beasts, and draw their power from the trust of such bonds. This doesn't mean that all guardians are peaceful&#151;indeed many use violent means to further their goals and safeguard those they watch over. But they find worth in those who travel with them. In battle, none can take the sort of punishment and wounds that a guardian can sustain.</p>
<p><b>Role</b>: When others would retreat, you stand your ground. Your place is at the front of the battle, taking every hit your enemies can give while daring them to dish out more. Your job is to stop your enemies' advance, interposing yourself in the path of peril. You'll gladly take all that brutal punishment and return the beating with zeal. The wounds you suffer might kill a lesser hero, but you relish the thrill of combat, confident that your physical and mental perfection will lead to victory.</p>
<p><b>Classes</b>: Any class that is frequently in the middle of a chaotic melee will find many valuable abilities within the guardian path. Barbarians, cavaliers, fighters, inquisitors, monks, and paladins all make excellent guardians. Some of the guardian's powers also lend themselves to the druid, ranger, or even the summoner, granting bonuses to companions and allies.</p>
<p><b>Bonus Hit Points</b>: Whenever you gain a guardian tier, you gain 5 bonus hit points. These hit points stack with themselves, and don't affect your overall Hit Dice or other statistics.</p>

          <text type="formattedtext"><h>Hierophant</h>
<p>Those who draw upon a god's power find themselves becoming closer to the divine. Some aspire to become immortal servants of their gods, and others reach for apotheosis itself. A hierophant could be either of these, channeling divine power directly or indirectly&#151;whether from a deity, the spirit of nature, or the power of life itself&#151;and eventually becoming more like a patron of divine power than a mere devotee.</p>
<p><b>Role</b>: As a hierophant, your role in the group is to act as a conduit to the divine, healing and helping your allies through the miracles that you bestow. This focus is just as strong if you are instead a servant of nature, using the powers granted to you by this path to protect the wilderness and bring its fury to those who would dare to defile it.</p>
<p><b>Classes</b>: Members of any class that draws upon divine magic will find the path of the hierophant useful&#151;particularly clerics, druids, and oracles. Even classes with limited divine spellcasting, such as the inquisitor and paladin, have a number of useful options in this path.</p>
<p><b>Bonus Hit Points</b>: Whenever you gain a hierophant tier, you gain 4 bonus hit points. These hit points stack with themselves, and don't affect your overall Hit Dice or other statistics.</p>

<p>Some are destined not only to achieve personal greatness, but also to inspire armies, rally the fallen, and bring the most out of those who follow them. The marshal is such a leader, renowned for his vision, courage, and strategic acumen. Soldiers flock to a marshal's banner for a chance to serve under such a commander, confident that his skill will see them through even the most difficult challenges.</p>
<p><b>Role</b>: As a marshal, your abilities allow you to inspire mythic and non-mythic allies alike to greatness. In a group, you protect and push your allies to even greater acts of heroism. All the while, the powers of the marshal allow you to take the lead, help your companions, and take the fight to your enemies.</p>
<p><b>Classes</b>: Bards, cavaliers, clerics, inquisitors, and paladins will all find a host of useful abilities in the marshal path. In fact, almost any character who assists others, both during combat and afterward, will likewise find that the path of the marshal includes a number of valuable abilities that will help in her noble endeavors.</p>
<p><b>Bonus Hit Points</b>: Whenever you gain a marshal tier, you gain 4 bonus hit points. These hit points stack with themselves, and don't affect your overall Hit Dice or other statistics.</p>

<p>Seen only when they choose to be seen, tricksters manipulate kings and peasants alike, usually without anyone sensing their influence. Characters who rely upon their skills and wit find themselves drawn to the trickster's path. The mythic power of these heroes allows them to perform tasks that most would consider impossible. They can climb any wall, swim any current, and move without being seen by even the most observant guard. When they strike at their foes, they do so with unmatched accuracy.</p>
<p><b>Role</b>: As a trickster, your role in the party is one of deception and manipulation. You have access to a number of abilities that empower you to confound your foes, both physically and mentally. With a subtle jest or twist of phrase, you can steer entire cities and even nations to do your bidding&#151;but should that fail, you can always rely on a dagger from the shadows.</p>
<p><b>Classes</b>: Members of any class that relies on skills would make good tricksters, as would those who heavily utilize ranged combat or magical methods of subterfuge. The alchemist, bard, and rogue all have a number of abilities that fit well with the trickster. Gunslingers, monks, and rangers will also find that the trickster has more than a few interesting options.</p>
<p><b>Bonus Hit Points</b>: Whenever you gain a trickster tier, you gain 4 bonus hit points. These hit points stack with themselves, and don't affect your overall Hit Dice or other statistics.</p>

<h>Trickster Builds</h>
<p>When selecting your trickster's path abilities, you may wish to consider the following themes. Each one suggests a variety of complementary path abilities, with different interpretations of what it means to be mythic master of surprise.

At 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th tiers, another ability score of your choice permanently increases by 2; this can be an ability score you've already increased or a different ability score.</p>
<p><b>Mythic Feat</b>: Select one mythic feat or non-mythic feat as a bonus feat. You must qualify for this feat normally. You gain another mythic feat at 3rd tier, and again every 2 tiers thereafter.</p>

        <text type="formattedtext"><h>Gaining Tiers</h>
<p>A character's mythic power is classified by tier, with a 1st-tier mythic character already being significantly more powerful than a non-mythic character of the same level and a 10th-tier mythic character possessing nearly godlike puissance. Mythic tiers are similar to levels in a class or prestige class in that the powers gained at each tier are added to all those that came before, but tiers are gained in a different manner from levels. A character gains a new mythic tier by completing a number of trials that occur during play. A trial is a difficult task that adds to the legend and story of your character. Achieving a new mythic tier occurs independently of experience point progression (though you will also gain experience points for the various encounters you complete as you progress through your trials).</p>
<p>Trials are moments in the story when you must rise above the deeds of lesser heroes. These moments become critical junctures in your legend. The GM decides what qualifies as a trial, and it's up to you to complete it as you would other adventures. You might not even know you are attempting a trial until it is completed and the GM informs you to note it on your mythic character sheet, though you'll likely get an inkling when you find yourself facing a particularly challenging foe or attempting something that most would find impossible.</p>
<p>The number of trials required to attain each new tier appears on the Mythic Trials per Tier table. For example, suppose a 5th-level fighter discovers her mythic heritage and becomes a 1st-tier champion. Over a number of sessions, she earns enough experience points to gain her 6th level of fighter. During this time, she doesn't complete a trial, so she doesn't advance to the next tier of the champion path. During the next session, however, she engages in a climactic battle against a mythic troll that has plagued the town for years; by defeating the troll, she completes her trial, allowing her to become a 2nd-tier champion. To reach 3rd tier, she will need to accomplish two more trials. A mythic character can't gain more than 10 tiers.</p>
<p>Note that the number of trials needed to achieve the next tier might vary from the number listed on the table below. The GM can reduce or increase this number as needed to suit the campaign&#151;refer to the Mythic Trials section for more guidance.</p>
