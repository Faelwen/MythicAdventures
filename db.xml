Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike.</p><p>Any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you're blinking unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. Your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane (but they might affect targets on the Ethereal Plane).</p><p>While blinking, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane).

If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled.</p><p>Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures.

All creatures gain concealment (20% miss chance) in dim light. All creatures gain total concealment (50% miss chance) in darkness. Creatures with darkvision can see in an area of dim light or darkness without penalty.

        <description type="formattedtext"><h>Normal Use</h><p>You can use <i>dispel magic </i>to end one ongoing spell that has been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by <i>dispel magic</i>. <i>Dispel magic </i>can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the <i>dispel magic </i>can take effect. </p><p>You choose to use <i>dispel magic </i>in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell.</p><p><i>Targeted Dispel</i>: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the <i>dispel magic </i>spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell's caster level). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell.</p><p> For example, a 7th-level caster casts <i>dispel magic</i>, targeting a creature affected by <i>stoneskin </i>(caster level 12th) and <i>fly</i> (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the <i>stoneskin</i> (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the <i>fly</i> (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the <i>stoneskin</i> would have been dispelled, leaving the <i>fly </i>intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected.</p><p>You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a <i>wall of fire</i>). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect.</p><p>If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by <i>summon monster</i>), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.</p><p>If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level (DC = 11 + the item's caster level). If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a <i>bag of holding</i>) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.</p><p>You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.</p><p><i>Counterspell</i>: When <i>dispel magic </i>is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, <i>dispel magic </i>may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.</p></description>

The powerful shockwave created by this spell knocks creatures down, collapses structures, opens cracks in the ground, and more. The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures on the ground can't move or attack. A spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast. The earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area. The specific effect of an <i>earthquake </i>spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast.</p><p><i>Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel</i>: The roof collapses, dealing 8d6 points of damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC 15 half) and pinning that creature beneath the rubble (see below). An <i>earthquake </i>cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris and rubble.</p><p><i>Cliffs</i>:<i> Earthquake </i>causes a cliff to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it falls vertically. Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).</p><p><i>Open Ground</i>: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure). The fissures are 40 feet deep. At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut. Treat all trapped creatures as if they were in the bury zone of an avalanche, trapped without air (see Environment for more details).</p><p><i>Structure</i>: Any structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).</p><p><i>River, Lake, or Marsh</i>: Fissures open under the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand. At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.</p><p><i>Pinned Beneath Rubble</i>: Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a pinned character falls unconscious, he or she must make a DC 15 Constitution check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead.</p></description>

An acorn grenade has a range increment of 20 feet. A ranged touch attack roll is required to strike the intended target. Together, the acorns are capable of dealing 1d4 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d4) divided among the acorns as you wish. No acorn can deal more than 10d4 points of damage.</p><p>Each acorn grenade explodes upon striking any hard surface. In addition to its regular fire damage, all creatures adjacent to the explosion take 1 point of fire damage per die of the explosion. This explosion of fire ignites any combustible materials adjacent to the target.</p><p><i>Holly Berry Bombs</i>: You turn as many as eight holly berries into special bombs. The holly berries are usually placed by hand, since they are too light to make effective thrown weapons (they can be tossed only 5 feet). If you are within 200 feet and speak a word of command, each berry instantly bursts into flame, causing 1d8 points of fire damage + 1 point per caster level to every creature in a 5-foot-radius burst and igniting any combustible materials within 5 feet.

        <description type="formattedtext"><h>Normal Use</h><p>This powerful inscription harms those who enter, pass, or open the warded area or object. A <i>glyph of warding </i>can guard a bridge or passage, ward a portal, trap a chest or box, and so on.</p><p>You set all of the conditions of the ward. Typically, any creature entering the warded area or opening the warded object without speaking a password (which you set when casting the spell) is subject to the magic it stores. Alternatively or in addition to a password trigger, glyphs can be set according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature type, subtype, or kind. Glyphs can also be set with respect to good, evil, law, or chaos, or to pass those of your religion. They cannot be set according to class, HD, or level. Glyphs respond to invisible creatures normally but are not triggered by those who travel past them ethereally. Multiple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area. However, if a cabinet has three different drawers, each can be separately warded.</p><p>When casting the spell, you weave a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. A glyph can be placed to conform to any shape up to the limitations of your total square footage. When the spell is completed, the glyph and tracery become nearly invisible.</p><p>Glyphs cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they can be dispelled. <i>Mislead</i>, <i>polymorph</i>, and <i>nondetection </i>(and similar magical effects) can fool a glyph, though nonmagical disguises and the like can't. <i>Read magic </i>allows you to identify a <i>glyph of warding </i>with a DC 13 Knowledge (arcana) check. Identifying the glyph does not discharge it and allows you to know the basic nature of the glyph (version, type of damage caused, what spell is stored).</p><p><i>Note</i>: Magic traps such as <i>glyph of warding </i>are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use Perception to find a glyph, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to disarm it</p></description>

        <description type="formattedtext"><h>Normal Use</h><p>A <i>grease </i>spell covers a solid surface with a layer of slippery grease. Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a successful Reflex save or fall. A creature can walk within or through the area of grease at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means it can't move that round (and must then make a Reflex save or fall), while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Acrobatics skill for details). Creatures that do not move on their turn do not need to make this check and are not considered flat-footed.</p><p>The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item. Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while an object wielded or employed by a creature requires its bearer to make a Reflex saving throw to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made in each round that the creature attempts to pick up or use the <i>greased </i>item. A creature wearing <i>greased </i>armor or clothing gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks made to escape a grapple, and to their CMD to avoid being grappled.</p><h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>If you cast <i>mythic grease</i> on an area, add your tier to the Acrobatics DC to move within or through the area.

        <description type="formattedtext"><h>Normal Use</h><p>This powerful spell is primarily used to defend a stronghold or fortress by creating a number of magical wards and effects. The ward protects 200 square feet per caster level. The warded area can be as much as 20 feet high, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them; you must be somewhere within the area to be warded to cast the spell. The spell creates the following magical effects within the warded area.</p><p><i>Fog</i>: Fog fills all corridors, obscuring all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). Saving Throw: none. Spell Resistance: no.</p><p><i>Arcane Locks</i>: All doors in the warded area are <i>arcane locked. </i>Saving Throw: none. Spell Resistance: no.</p><p><i>Webs</i>: Webs fill all stairs from top to bottom. These strands are identical with those created by the <i>web </i>spell, except that they regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while the <i>guards and wards </i>spell lasts. Saving Throw: Reflex negates; see text for <i>web</i>. Spell Resistance: no.</p><p><i>Confusion</i>: Where there are choices in direction&#151;such as a corridor intersection or side passage&#151;a minor <i>confusion-</i>type effect functions so as to make it 50% probable that intruders believe they are going in the opposite direction from the one they actually chose. This is a mind-affecting effect. Saving Throw: none. Spell Resistance: yes.</p><p><i>Lost Doors</i>: One door per caster level is covered by a <i>silent image </i>to appear as if it were a plain wall. Saving Throw: Will disbelief (if interacted with). Spell Resistance: no.</p><p>In addition, you can place your choice of one of the following five magical effects.</p><p>1. <i>Dancing lights </i>in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that causes the lights to repeat as long as the <i>guards and wards </i>spell lasts. Saving Throw: none. Spell Resistance: no.</p><p>2. A <i>magic mouth </i>in two places. Saving Throw: none. Spell Resistance: no.</p><p>3. A <i>stinking cloud </i>in two places. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while the <i>guards and wards </i>spell lasts. Saving Throw: Fortitude negates; see text for <i>stinking cloud. </i>Spell Resistance: no.</p><p>4. A <i>gust of wind </i>in one corridor or room. Saving Throw: Fortitude negates. Spell Resistance: yes.</p><p>5. A <i>suggestion </i>in one place. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature who enters or passes through the area receives the <i>suggestion </i>mentally. Saving Throw: Will negates. Spell Resistance: yes.</p><p>The whole warded area radiates strong magic of the abjuration school. A <i>dispel magic </i>cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect. A successful <i>mage's disjunction </i>destroys the entire <i>guards and wards </i>effect.</p></description>

The attack is made using the creature's full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by a <i>speed</i> weapon, nor does it actually grant an extra action, so you can't use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round.)</p><p>A hasted creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. Any condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.</p><p>All of the hasted creature's modes of movement (including land movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the subject's normal speed using that form of movement. This increase counts as an enhancement bonus, and it affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for increased speed.

        <description type="formattedtext"><h>Normal Use</h><p>The creature or object touched becomes invisible. If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so.</p><p>Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible.</p><p>Of course, the subject is not magically silenced<i>, </i>and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as swimming in water or stepping in a puddle). If a check is required, a stationary invisible creature has a +40 bonus on its Stealth checks. This bonus is reduced to +20 if the creature is moving. The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions. Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as <i>bless </i>that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.</p><p><i>Invisibility </i>can be made permanent (on objects only) with a <i>permanency </i>spell.</p></description>

        <description type="formattedtext"><h>Normal Use</h><p><i>Meteor swarm </i>is a very powerful and spectacular spell that is similar to <i>fireball </i>in many aspects. When you cast it, four 2-foot-diameter spheres spring from your outstretched hand and streak in straight lines to the spots you select. The meteor spheres leave a fiery trail of sparks.</p><p>If you aim a sphere at a specific creature, you may make a ranged touch attack to strike the target with the meteor. Any creature struck by a sphere takes 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage (no save) and takes a -4 penalty on the saving throw against the sphere's fire damage (see below). If a targeted sphere misses its target, it simply explodes at the nearest corner of the target's space. You may aim more than one sphere at the same target.</p><p>Once a sphere reaches its destination, it explodes in a 40-foot-radius spread, dealing 6d6 points of fire damage to each creature in the area. If a creature is within the area of more than one sphere, it must save separately against each. Despite stemming from separate spheres, all of the fire damage is added together after the saves have been made, and fire resistance is applied only once.</p></description>

When used against the selected creature, the ammunition never misfires and is unaffected by concealment (but not total concealment), and at a range of 30 feet or less, the attack targets the selected creature's touch AC. When the target hits the selected creature, you must overcome that creature's spell resistance, or this spell has no effect. A normal hit scored using the target against the selected creature is considered to be a critical threat and deals 1 extra point of damage per caster level (maximum 20), which is not multiplied on a critical hit. A natural critical hit deals the same extra damage, but that damage is multiplied due to the critical.</p><p>Once the target is used to attack the selected creature, successfully or not, this spell is discharged.</p></description>

        <description type="formattedtext"><h>Normal Use</h><p>This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from mental control, and from summoned creatures. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.</p><p>First, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures.</p><p>Second, the subject immediately receives another saving throw (if one was allowed to begin with) against any spells or effects that possess or exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment [charm] effects and enchantment [compulsion] effects, such as <i>charm person</i>, <i>command</i>, and <i>dominate person</i>. This saving throw is made with a +2 morale bonus, using the same DC as the original effect. If successful, such effects are suppressed for the duration of this spell. The effects resume when the duration of this spell expires. While under the effects of this spell, the target is immune to any new attempts to possess or exercise mental control over the target. This spell does not expel a controlling life force (such as a ghost or spellcaster using <i>magic</i> <i>jar</i>), but it does prevent them from controlling the target. This second effect only functions against spells and effects created by evil creatures or objects, subject to GM discretion.</p><p>Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by evil summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Summoned creatures that are not evil are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.</p></description>

        <description type="formattedtext"><h>Normal Use</h><p>Any opponent attempting to directly attack the warded creature, even with a targeted spell, must attempt a Will save. If the save succeeds, the opponent can attack normally and is unaffected by that casting of the spell. If the save fails, the opponent can't follow through with the attack, that part of its action is lost, and it can't directly attack the warded creature for the duration of the spell. Those not attempting to attack the subject remain unaffected. This spell does not prevent the warded creature from being attacked or affected by area of effect spells. The subject cannot attack without breaking the spell but may use nonattack spells or otherwise act.</p></description>

The target takes a -1 penalty for every 5 feet of distance between it and its tethered square. Failing this check means the target's move is wasted and it cannot move farther away.

        <description type="formattedtext"><h>Normal Use</h><p>A weapon made of force appears and attacks foes at a distance, as you direct it, dealing 1d8 force damage per hit, + 1 point per three caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you (see below) and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the reduction in damage associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats or combat actions do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers.</p><p>Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round's target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to. Even if the <i>spiritual weapon </i>is a ranged weapon, use the spell's range, not the weapon's normal range increment, and switching targets still is a move action.</p><p>A <i>spiritual weapon </i>cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>disintegrate</i>, a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>, or a <i>rod of cancellation </i>affects it. A <i>spiritual weapon</i>'s AC against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object).</p><p>If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the <i>spiritual weapon </i>strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.</p><p>The weapon that you get is often a force replica of your deity's own personal weapon. A cleric without a deity gets a weapon based on his alignment. A neutral cleric without a deity can create a <i>spiritual weapon </i>of any alignment, provided he is acting at least generally in accord with that alignment at the time. The weapons associated with each alignment are as follows: chaos (battleaxe), evil (light flail), good (warhammer), law (longsword).</p></description>

        <description type="formattedtext"><h>Normal Use</h><p>You move objects or creatures by concentrating on them. Depending on the version selected, the spell can provide a gentle, sustained force, perform a variety of combat maneuvers, or exert a single short, violent thrust.</p><p><i>Sustained Force</i>: A sustained force moves an object weighing no more than 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level) up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with spell resistance.</p><p>This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or in both directions. An object cannot be moved beyond your range. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops.</p><p>An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require DC 15 Intelligence checks.</p><p><i>Combat Maneuver</i>: Alternatively, once per round, you can use <i>telekinesis </i>to perform a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don't provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your Combat Maneuver Bonus, and you add your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier. No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration.</p><p><i>Violent Thrust</i>: Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object or creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).</p><p>You must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects). Objects and creatures that miss their target land in a square adjacent to the target.</p><p>Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell.</p><p>If a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).</p></description>

        <description type="formattedtext"><h>Normal Use</h><p>You alter the area's terrain and climate to a new terrain and climate type appropriate to the planet or plane. For example, you might transform a desert to plains. To cast this spell, you must expend 10 uses of mythic power along with the material cost. This magically alters the area's climate and normal plants to those appropriate to the new terrain, but doesn't affect creatures or the configuration of the earth. Transforming rocky hills into forested areas converts grasses into shrubs and small trees, but doesn't flatten the hills or change the animals to suit the new environment.</p><p>You can alter the climate by one step (warm, temperate, or cold). The maximum extent of the terrain change is up to the GM, but in general is to a similar terrain type or one step within that terrain type (such as from a typical forest to a forest with massive trees or light undergrowth, from a shallow bog to a deep bog, and so on). You might be able to shift the land to a similar terrain type, such as turning a sparse forest into a relatively dry swamp. Local creatures adversely affected by these alterations either flee the area or quickly die, depending on their mobility and awareness of the change.</p><p>Multiple castings of the spell in the same area can create an area with radically different terrain and climate than the surrounding land. The GM can decide that certain terrain shifts are unsustainable and shorten the duration, or that some are suitable for the area and extend the duration.</p><p>This spell could have many secondary effects based on the nature of the change, the type of bordering terrain, and so on; these should be determined by the GM on a case-by-case basis. For example, transforming a desert requires drawing water up from underground to sustain the plants, which could deplete the water table in nearby areas. Creating a warm desert in the middle of a snowy tundra will create a bordering area of mud and frequent storms from the clash of hot and cold air fronts.</p><p>If you're at least 8th tier, you can expend 20 uses of mythic power instead of 10 to increase the range to 1 mile, the area to a 1-mile-radius emanation centered on you, and the duration to 1 month per caster level.</p></description>

The twin can attempt attacks of opportunity using your base attack bonus, but has no ability score modifiers, skills, or feats. It threatens an area appropriate for your size and wields a copy of the weapon you were wielding when you cast <i>mythic vomit twin</i>. If the twin's weapon is destroyed or disarmed, on your turn the twin generates a new weapon from its own substance. Its attacks deal damage using that weapon's die type.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (5th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you create two copies when you cast the spell, and both can be active at the same time. If you instead expend three uses of mythic power, you create three copies when you cast the spell, and all three can be active at the same time.</p></description>

        <description type="formattedtext"><h>Normal Use</h><p>This spell creates an anchored plane of ice or a hemisphere of ice, depending on the version selected. A <i>wall of ice </i>cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Any creature adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt a Reflex save to disrupt the wall as it is being formed. A successful save indicates that the spell automatically fails. Fire can melt a <i>wall of ice, </i>and it deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects). Suddenly melting a <i>wall of ice </i>creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes.</p><p><i>Ice Plane</i>: A sheet of strong, hard ice appears. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level. It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th-level wizard can create a <i>wall of ice</i> 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, or any other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,000 square feet). The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides.</p><p>Each 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level.</p><p>Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point per caster level (no save).</p><p><i>Hemisphere</i>: The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet + 1 foot per caster level. The <i>hemisphere </i>is as hard to break through as the <i>ice plane </i>form, but it does not deal damage to those who go through a breach.</p></description>

The wall inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. It must always be a flat plane, though you can shape its edges to fit the available space.</p><p>A <i>wall of iron </i>is 1 inch thick per four caster levels. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 25 + 2 per inch of thickness.</p><p>If you desire, the wall can be created vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left unpushed. Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly. A creature must make a DC 40 Strength check to push the wall over. Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful Reflex saves. Any Large or smaller creature that fails takes 10d6 points of damage while fleeing from the wall. The wall cannot crush Huge and larger creatures.</p><p>Like any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation, and other natural phenomena.

The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.</p><p>Unlike a <i>wall of iron, </i>you can create a <i>wall of stone </i>in almost any shape you desire.

It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell's area by half. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area.</p><p>Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a <i>disintegrate </i>spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping.

        <description type="formattedtext"><h>Normal Use</h><p>A <i>wall of thorns </i>spell creates a barrier of very tough, pliable, tangled brush bearing needle-sharp thorns as long as a human's finger. Any creature forced into or attempting to move through a <i>wall of thorns </i>takes piercing damage per round of movement equal to 25 minus the creature's AC. Dexterity and dodge bonuses to AC do not count for this calculation. (Creatures with an AC of 25 or higher, without considering Dexterity and dodge bonuses, take no damage from contact with the wall.)</p><p>You can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape the wall as a number of 10-by-10-by-5-foot blocks equal to twice your caster level. This has no effect on the damage dealt by the thorns, but any creature attempting to break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier.</p><p>Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a Strength check as a full-round action. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds 20, a creature moves 5 feet (up to a maximum distance equal to its normal land speed). Of course, moving or attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as described above. A creature trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage.</p><p>Any creature within the area of the spell when it is cast takes damage as if it had moved into the wall and is caught inside. In order to escape, it must attempt to push its way free, or it can wait until the spell ends. Creatures with the ability to pass through overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a <i>wall of thorns </i>at normal speed without taking damage.</p><p>A <i>wall of thorns </i>can be breached by slow work with edged weapons. Chopping away at the wall creates a safe passage 1 foot deep for every 10 minutes of work. Normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but magical fire burns it away in 10 minutes.</p></description>

These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears. Creatures caught within a web become grappled by the sticky fibers.

If this save succeeds, the creature is inside the web but is otherwise unaffected. If the save fails, the creature gains the grappled condition, but can break free by making a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check as a standard action against the DC of this spell. The entire area of the web is considered difficult terrain.

All creatures adjacent to an aboleth must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save each round or lose the ability to breathe air (but gain the ability to breathe water) for 3 hours. Renewed contact with an aboleth's mucus cloud and failing another save extends the effect for another 3 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Mucus Mist (Ex)</b> When exposed to the air, a mythic aboleth can release its mucus as a fine mist. This obscures vision like obscuring mist and has the same properties as its mucus cloud. Creatures that breathe water are able to breathe normally while within the cloud. The mist moves with the aboleth. </p><p><b>Slime (Ex)</b> A creature hit by an aboleth's tentacle must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or its skin and flesh transform into a clear, slimy membrane over the course of 1d4 rounds. The creature's new "flesh" is soft and tender, reducing its Constitution score by 4 as long as the transformation persists. If the creature's flesh isn't kept moist, it dries quickly and the victim takes 1d12 points of damage every 10 minutes. Remove disease and similar effects can restore an afflicted creature to normal, but immunity to disease offers no protection from this attack. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Slime Armor (Ex)</b> A mythic aboleth can spend 1 minute to create an armorlike carapace from hardened slime. This gives it a +4 armor bonus, reduces its swim speed to 30 feet, and increases its land speed to 30 feet.

Blink has several effects, as follows.\r\rPhysical attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn't help opponents, since you're ethereal and not merely invisible. If the attack is capable of striking ethereal creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for concealment).\r\rIf the attacker can see invisible creatures, the miss chance is also only 20%. (For an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures, there is no miss chance.) Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike.\r\rAny individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you're blinking unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. Your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane (but they might affect targets on the Ethereal Plane).\r\rWhile blinking, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane). Although you are only partially visible, you are not considered invisible and targets retain their Dexterity bonus to AC against your attacks. You do receive a +2 bonus on attack rolls made against enemies that cannot see invisible creatures.\r\rYou take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.\r\rWhile blinking, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled.\r\rSince you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures. You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones.\r\rAn ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down. As an incorporeal creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures.\r\rAn ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.\r\rForce effects and abjurations affect you normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things.

Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends safely in this way if the fly spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an antimagic field.  </description></id-00001></spells> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level3> <level4> <level type="number">4</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells/> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level4> <level5> <level type="number">5</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells idcounter="2"><id-00001> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">1</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Telekinesis (at will)</name> <school type="string">transmutation</school> <level type="string">sorcerer/wizard 5, magus 5</level> <components type="string">V, S</components> <castingtime type="string">1 standard action</castingtime> <range type="string">long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)</range> <effect type="string"> or see text</effect> <duration type="string">concentration (up to 1 round/level) or instantaneous; see text</duration> <save type="string">Will negates (object) or none; see text</save> <sr type="string">yes (object); see text</sr> <shortdescription type="string">Moves object, attacks creature, or hurls object or creature.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">You move objects or creatures by concentrating on them.\r\rDepending on the version selected, the spell can provide a gentle, sustained force, perform a variety of combat maneuvers, or exert a single short, violent thrust.\r\rSustained Force: A sustained force moves an object weighing no more than 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level) up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with spell resistance.\r\rThis version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or in both directions. An object cannot be moved beyond your range. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops.\r\rAn object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require DC 15 Intelligence checks.\r\rCombat Maneuver: Alternatively, once per round, you can use telekinesis to perform a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don't provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your Combat Maneuver Bonus, and you add your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier. No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration.\r\rViolent Thrust: Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object or creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects.\r\rYou can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).\r\rYou must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects).\r\rObjects and creatures that miss their target land in a square adjacent to the target.\r\rCreatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell.\r\rIf a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).  </description></id-00001></spells> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level5> <level6> <level type="number">6</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells idcounter="4"><id-00001> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">3</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Blade Barrier</name> <school type="string">evocation[force]</school> <level type="string">cleric 6, inquisitor 6</level> <components type="string">V, S</components> <castingtime type="string">1 standard action</castingtime> <range type="string">medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</range> <effect type="string"> wall of whirling blades up to 20 ft. long/level, or a ringed wall of whirling blades with a radius of up to 5 ft. per two levels; either form is 20 ft. high</effect> <duration type="string">1 min./level</duration> <save type="string">Reflex half or Reflex negates; see text</save> <sr type="string">yes</sr> <shortdescription type="string">Wall of blades deals 1d6/level damage.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">An immobile, vertical curtain of whirling blades shaped of pure force springs into existence.

See the accompanying table for possible consequences and results of the attempt. The powers reply in a language you understand, but they resent such contact and give only brief answers to your questions. All questions are answered with "yes," "no," "maybe," "never," "irrelevant," or some other one-word answer.\r\rYou must concentrate on maintaining the spell (a standard action) in order to ask questions at the rate of one per round. A question is answered by the power during the same round. You may ask one question for every two caster levels.\r\rContact with minds far removed from your home plane increases the probability that you will incur a decrease in Intelligence and Charisma due to your brain being overwhelmed, but also increases the chance of the power knowing the answer and answering correctly. Once the Outer Planes are reached, the power of the deity contacted determines the effects. (Random results obtained from the table are subject to the personalities of individual deities.) On rare occasions, this divination may be blocked by an act of certain deities or forces.\r\rAvoid Int/Cha Decrease: You must succeed on an Intelligence check against this DC to avoid a decrease in Intelligence and Charisma. If the check fails, your Intelligence and Charisma scores each fall to 8 for the stated duration, and you become unable to cast arcane spells. If you lose Intelligence and Charisma, the effect strikes as soon as the first question is asked, and no answer is received. If a successful contact is made, roll d% to determine the type of answer you gain.\r\rTrue Answer: You get a true, one-word answer.

A creature can negate the effect on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with spell resistance.\r\rThis version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration.

You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require DC 15 Intelligence checks.\r\rCombat Maneuver: Alternatively, once per round, you can use telekinesis to perform a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don't provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your Combat Maneuver Bonus, and you add your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier.

You can hurl one object or creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects.\r\rYou can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).\r\rYou must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects).\r\rObjects and creatures that miss their target land in a square adjacent to the target.\r\rCreatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell.\r\rIf a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).  </description></id-00001></spells> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level5> <level6> <level type="number">6</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells/> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level6> <level7> <level type="number">7</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells idcounter="2"><id-00001> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">1</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Teleport, Greater (at will)</name> <school type="string">conjuration(teleportation)</school> <level type="string">sorcerer/wizard 7, summoner 5, witch 7</level> <components type="string">V</components> <castingtime type="string">1 standard action</castingtime> <range type="string">personal and touch</range> <effect type="string"> you and touched objects or other touched willing creatures</effect> <duration type="string">instantaneous</duration> <save type="string">none and Will negates (object)</save> <sr type="string">no and yes (object)</sr> <shortdescription type="string">As teleport, but no range limit and no off-target arrival.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">This spell functions like teleport, except that there is no range limit and there is no chance you arrive off target.

A wall of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Any creature adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt a Reflex save to disrupt the wall as it is being formed. A successful save indicates that the spell automatically fails.\r\rFire can melt a wall of ice, and it deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects). Suddenly melting a wall of ice creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes.\r\rIce Plane: A sheet of strong, hard ice appears. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level. It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th-level wizard can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, or any other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,000 square feet). The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides.\r\rEach 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness.\r\rCreatures can hit the wall automatically. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level.\r\rEven when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point per caster level (no save).\r\rHemisphere: The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet + 1 foot per caster level. The hemisphere is as hard to break through as the ice plane form, but it does not deal damage to those who go through a breach.  </description></id-00002></spells> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level4> <level5> <level type="number">5</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells/> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level5> <level6> <level type="number">6</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells/> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level6> <level7> <level type="number">7</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells idcounter="2"><id-00001> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">1</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Teleport, Greater (at will)</name> <school type="string">conjuration(teleportation)</school> <level type="string">sorcerer/wizard 7, summoner 5, witch 7</level> <components type="string">V</components> <castingtime type="string">1 standard action</castingtime> <range type="string">personal and touch</range> <effect type="string"> you and touched objects or other touched willing creatures</effect> <duration type="string">instantaneous</duration> <save type="string">none and Will negates (object)</save> <sr type="string">no and yes (object)</sr> <shortdescription type="string">As teleport, but no range limit and no off-target arrival.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">This spell functions like teleport, except that there is no range limit and there is no chance you arrive off target.

Using a fly spell requires only as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells normally. The subject of a fly spell can charge but not run, and it cannot carry aloft more weight than its maximum load, plus any armor it wears. The subject gains a bonus on Fly skill checks equal to 1/2 your caster level.\r\rShould the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends safely in this way if the fly spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an antimagic field.  </description></id-00001></spells> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level3> <level4> <level type="number">4</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells idcounter="3"><id-00001> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">1</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Ice Storm (at will)</name> <school type="string">evocation[cold]</school> <level type="string">druid 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, witch 4, magus 4</level> <components type="string">V, S, M/DF (dust and water)</components> <castingtime type="string">1 standard action</castingtime> <range type="string">long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)</range> <effect type="string">cylinder (20-ft. radius, 40 ft. high)</effect> <duration type="string">1 round/level</duration> <save type="string">none</save> <sr type="string">yes</sr> <shortdescription type="string">Hail deals 5d6 damage in cylinder 40 ft. across.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">Great magical hailstones pound down upon casting this spell, dealing 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 2d6 points of cold damage to every creature in the area.

A wall of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Any creature adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt a Reflex save to disrupt the wall as it is being formed. A successful save indicates that the spell automatically fails.\r\rFire can melt a wall of ice, and it deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects). Suddenly melting a wall of ice creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes.\r\rIce Plane: A sheet of strong, hard ice appears. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level. It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th-level wizard can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, or any other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,000 square feet). The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides.\r\rEach 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness.\r\rCreatures can hit the wall automatically. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level.\r\rEven when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point per caster level (no save).\r\rHemisphere: The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet + 1 foot per caster level. The hemisphere is as hard to break through as the ice plane form, but it does not deal damage to those who go through a breach.  </description></id-00002></spells> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level4> <level5> <level type="number">5</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells idcounter="3"><id-00001> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">1</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Cone of Cold (at will)</name> <school type="string">evocation[cold]</school> <level type="string">sorcerer/wizard 5, witch 6, magus 5</level> <components type="string">V, S, M (a small crystal or glass cone)</components> <castingtime type="string">1 standard action</castingtime> <range type="string">60 ft.</range> <effect type="string">cone-shaped burst</effect> <duration type="string">instantaneous</duration> <save type="string">Reflex half</save> <sr type="string">yes</sr> <shortdescription type="string">1d6/level cold damage.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">Cone of cold creates an area of extreme cold, originating at your hand and extending outward in a cone.

The noise a ghost sound spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from 16 humans, while a roaring dragon is equal to the noise from 32 humans.

A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect.\r\rYou choose to use dispel magic in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell.\r\rTargeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell's caster level). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell.\r\rFor example, a 7th-level caster casts dispel magic, targeting a creature affected by stoneskin (caster level 12th) and fly (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the stoneskin (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the fly (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the stoneskin would have been dispelled, leaving the fly intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected.\r\rYou can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a wall of fire). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect.\r\rIf you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.\r\rIf the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level (DC = 11 + the item's caster level). If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.\r\rYou automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.\r\rCounterspell: When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.  </description></id-00001> <id-00002> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">1</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Displacement</name> <school type="string">illusion(glamer)</school> <level type="string">bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, alchemist 3, summoner 3, magus 3</level> <components type="string">V, M (a small loop of leather)</components> <castingtime type="string">1 standard action</castingtime> <range type="string">touch</range> <effect type="string"> creature touched</effect> <duration type="string">1 round/level</duration> <save type="string">Will negates (harmless)</save> <sr type="string">yes (harmless)</sr> <shortdescription type="string">Attacks miss subject 50% of the time.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">The subject of this spell appears to be about 2 feet away from its true location.

(This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by a speed weapon, nor does it actually grant an extra action, so you can't use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round.) A hasted creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. Any condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.\r\rAll of the hasted creature's modes of movement (including land movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the subject's normal speed using that form of movement.

The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.\r\rTo see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the table at the end of this spell. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.\r\rFamiliarity: "Very familiar" is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. "Studied carefully" is a place you know well, either because you can currently physically see it or you've been there often. "Seen casually" is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. "Viewed once" is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic such as scrying.\r\r"False destination" is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.\r\rOn Target: You appear where you want to be.\r\rOff Target: You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is d% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly.\r\rSimilar Area: You wind up in an area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell's range, the spell simply fails instead.\r\rMishap: You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten "scrambled." You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80.\r\rEach time "Mishap" comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll.\r\r \r\r | Familiarity | On Target | Off Target | Similar Area | mishap\r\r | Very familiar | 01-97 | 98-99 | 100 | -\r\r | Studied carefully | 01-94 | 95-97 | 98-99 | 100\r\r | Seen casually | 01-88 | 89-94 | 95-98 | 99-100\r\r | Viewed once | 01-76 | 77-88 | 89-96 | 97-100\r\r | False destination | - | - | 81-92 | 93-100\r\r  </description></id-00002></spells> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level5> <level6> <level type="number">6</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells/> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level6> <level7> <level type="number">7</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells/> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level7> <level8> <level type="number">8</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells/> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level8> <level9> <level type="number">9</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells/> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level9> </levels> <parse type="number">1</parse> <points type="number">0</points> <pointsused type="number">0</pointsused> <sp type="number">0</sp> <availablelevel1 type="number">0</availablelevel1> <availablelevel2 type="number">0</availablelevel2> <availablelevel3 type="number">0</availablelevel3> <availablelevel4 type="number">0</availablelevel4> <availablelevel5 type="number">0</availablelevel5> </id-00001> </spellset> <spellmode type="string">preparation</spellmode> <spellset> <id-00002> <cc> <misc type="number">0</misc> </cc> <cl type="number">21</cl> <dc> <ability type="string">charisma</ability> </dc> <label type="string">Spell Like Abilities</label> <levels> <level0> <level type="number">0</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells/> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level0> <level1> <level type="number">1</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells idcounter="3"><id-00001> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">1</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Charm Person (at will)</name> <school type="string">enchantment(charm)[mind-affecting]</school> <level type="string">bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1, witch 1</level> <components type="string">V, S</components> <castingtime type="string">1 standard action</castingtime> <range type="string">close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</range> <effect type="string"> one humanoid creature</effect> <duration type="string">1 hour/level</duration> <save type="string">Will negates</save> <sr type="string">yes</sr> <shortdescription type="string">Makes one person your friend.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">This charm makes a humanoid creature regard you as its trusted friend and ally (treat the target's attitude as friendly).

If the condition is not met before the spell duration expires, the activity is not performed.\r\rA very reasonable suggestion causes the save to be made with a penalty (such as -1 or -2).  </description></id-00002></spells> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level3> <level4> <level type="number">4</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells idcounter="2"><id-00001> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">1</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Arcane Eye (at will)</name> <school type="string">divination(scrying)</school> <level type="string">sorcerer/wizard 4, witch 4, alchemist 4</level> <components type="string">V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)</components> <castingtime type="string">10 minutes</castingtime> <range type="string">unlimited</range> <effect type="string"> magical sensor</effect> <duration type="string">1 min./level</duration> <save type="string">none</save> <sr type="string">no</sr> <shortdescription type="string">Invisible floating eye moves 30 ft./round.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">You create an invisible magical sensor that sends you visual information.

An arcane eye travels at 30 feet per round (300 feet per minute) if viewing an area ahead as a human would (primarily looking at the floor) or 10 feet per round (100 feet per minute) if examining the ceiling and walls as well as the floor ahead. It sees exactly as you would see if you were there.\r\rThe eye can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. Solid barriers block its passage, but it can pass through a hole or space as small as 1 inch in diameter. The eye can't enter another plane of existence, even through a gate or similar magical portal.\r\rYou must concentrate to use an arcane eye.

The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.\r\r1st Round: Presence or absence of magical auras.\r\r2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.\r\r3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (arcana) skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a nonspell effect.) If the aura emanates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its properties (see Spellcraft).\r\rMagical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.\r\rAura Strength: An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.\r\r\r | Spell or Object | Aura Power \r\r | Faint | Moderate | Strong | Overwhelming \r\r | Functioning spell (spell level) | 3rd or lower | 4th-6th | 7th-9th | 10th+ (deity-level) \r\r | Magic item (caster level) | 5th or lower | 6th-11th | 12th-20th | 21st+ (artifact)\r\r Lingering Aura: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item).

Failure means it can't move that round (and must then make a Reflex save or fall), while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Acrobatics skill for details). Creatures that do not move on their turn do not need to make this check and are not considered flat-footed.\r\rThe spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item.\r\rMaterial objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while an object wielded or employed by a creature requires its bearer to make a Reflex saving throw to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made in each round that the creature attempts to pick up or use the greased item.

You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require DC 15 Intelligence checks.\r\rCombat Maneuver: Alternatively, once per round, you can use telekinesis to perform a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don't provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your Combat Maneuver Bonus, and you add your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier. No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration.\r\rViolent Thrust: Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object or creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects.\r\rYou can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).\r\rYou must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects).\r\rObjects and creatures that miss their target land in a square adjacent to the target.\r\rCreatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell.\r\rIf a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).  </description></id-00002> <id-00003> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">1</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Teleport</name> <school type="string">conjuration(teleportation)</school> <level type="string">sorcerer/wizard 5, summoner 4, witch 5, magus 5</level> <components type="string">V</components> <castingtime type="string">1 standard action</castingtime> <range type="string">personal and touch</range> <effect type="string"> you and touched objects or other touched willing creatures</effect> <duration type="string">instantaneous</duration> <save type="string">none and Will negates (object)</save> <sr type="string">no and yes (object)</sr> <shortdescription type="string">Instantly transports you as far as 100 miles per level.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster level. Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance.\r\rYou must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.\r\rTo see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the table at the end of this spell. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.\r\rFamiliarity: "Very familiar" is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. "Studied carefully" is a place you know well, either because you can currently physically see it or you've been there often. "Seen casually" is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. "Viewed once" is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic such as scrying.\r\r"False destination" is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.\r\rOn Target: You appear where you want to be.\r\rOff Target: You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is d% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly.\r\rSimilar Area: You wind up in an area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell's range, the spell simply fails instead.\r\rMishap: You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten "scrambled." You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80.\r\rEach time "Mishap" comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll.\r\r \r\r | Familiarity | On Target | Off Target | Similar Area | mishap\r\r | Very familiar | 01-97 | 98-99 | 100 | -\r\r | Studied carefully | 01-94 | 95-97 | 98-99 | 100\r\r | Seen casually | 01-88 | 89-94 | 95-98 | 99-100\r\r | Viewed once | 01-76 | 77-88 | 89-96 | 97-100\r\r | False destination | - | - | 81-92 | 93-100\r\r  </description></id-00003></spells> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level5> <level6> <level type="number">6</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells idcounter="4"><id-00001> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">1</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Dispel Magic, Greater</name> <school type="string">abjuration</school> <level type="string">bard 5, cleric 6, druid 6, sorcerer/wizard 6, witch 6, inquisitor 6, summoner 5, magus 6</level> <components type="string">V, S</components> <castingtime type="string">1 standard action</castingtime> <range type="string">medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</range> <effect type="string">20-ft.-radius burst one spellcaster, creature, or object</effect> <duration type="string">instantaneous</duration> <save type="string">none</save> <sr type="string">no</sr> <shortdescription type="string">Works as dispel magic, but can affect multiple targets.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">This spell functions like dispel magic, except that it can end more than one spell on a target and it can be used to target multiple creatures.\r\rYou choose to use greater dispel magic in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, area dispel, or a counterspell: Targeted Dispel: This functions as a targeted dispel magic, but it can dispel one spell for every four caster levels you possess, starting with the highest level spells and proceeding to lower level spells.\r\rAdditionally, greater dispel magic has a chance to dispel any effect that remove curse can remove, even if dispel magic can't dispel that effect. The DC of this check is equal to the curse's DC.\r\rArea Dispel: When greater dispel magic is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot-radius burst. Roll one dispel check and apply that check to each creature in the area, as if targeted by dispel magic. For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, apply the dispel check as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.\r\rFor each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the greater dispel magic spell, apply the dispel check to dispel the spell. For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the greater dispel magic spell, apply the dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.\r\rIf an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster) is in the area, apply the dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel one spell targeting the creature or object.\r\rYou may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.\r\rCounterspell: This functions as dispel magic, but you receive a +4 bonus on your dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.  </description></id-00001></spells> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level6> <level7> <level type="number">7</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells idcounter="4"><id-00001> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">1</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Insanity</name> <school type="string">enchantment(compulsion)[mind-affecting]</school> <level type="string">sorcerer/wizard 7, witch 7</level> <components type="string">V, S</components> <castingtime type="string">1 standard action</castingtime> <range type="string">medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</range> <effect type="string"> one living creature</effect> <duration type="string">instantaneous</duration> <save type="string">Will negates</save> <sr type="string">yes</sr> <shortdescription type="string">Subject suffers continuous confusion.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">The affected creature suffers from a continuous confusion effect, as the spell.\r\rRemove curse does not remove insanity.

Find the path works with respect to locations, not objects or creatures at a locale. The location must be on the same plane as the subject at the time of casting.

This divination is keyed to the recipient, not its companions, and its effect does not predict or allow for the actions of creatures (including guardians) who might take action to oppose the caster as he follows the path revealed by this spell.  </description></id-00001></spells> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level6> <level7> <level type="number">7</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells/> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level7> <level8> <level type="number">8</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells/> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level8> <level9> <level type="number">9</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells/> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level9> </levels> <parse type="number">1</parse> <points type="number">0</points> <pointsused type="number">0</pointsused> <sp type="number">0</sp> <availablelevel0 type="number">1</availablelevel0> <availablelevel2 type="number">1</availablelevel2> <availablelevel3 type="number">1</availablelevel3> <availablelevel4 type="number">1</availablelevel4> <availablelevel6 type="number">1</availablelevel6> </id-00002> </spellset> <xp type="number">1638400</xp> <text type="formattedtext"> <p>A ruddy glow emanates from beneath this dragon's red, gem-encrusted scales, like lava visible between cracks of cooling stone.</p> <p><b><u>Spell-Like Abilities</u></b> (CL 27th; concentration +34)</p><list><li><b>At will-</b>detect magic, find the path, pyrotechnics (DC 19), suggestion (DC 20), wall of fire</li></list> <p><b><u>Sorcerer Spells Known</u></b> (CL 17th; concentration +24)</p><list><li><b>8th (4)-</b>discern location, iron body</li><li><b>7th (7)-</b>insanity (DC 24), limited wishM, spell turning</li><li><b>6th (7)-</b>antimagic fieldM, contingencyM, greater dispel magic</li><li><b>5th (7)-</b>polymorph, telekinesis, teleport, wall of forceM</li><li><b>4th (7)-</b>fear (DC 21), fire shield, greater invisibility, stoneskinM</li><li><b>3rd (8)-</b>dispel magicM, displacement, hasteM, tongues</li><li><b>2nd (8)-</b>alter self, detect thoughts (DC 19), misdirection, resist energyM, see invisibility</li><li><b>1st (8)-</b>alarm, grease, magic missileM, shield, true strikeM M Mythic spell</li></list> <h><u>Special Abilities</u></h><p> <b>Fire Aura (Su)</b> A wyrm red dragon is surrounded by an aura of intense heat.

This ability allows it to move any fire effect in the area, as if it were the caster. This ability also allows it to reposition a stationary fire effect, although the new placement must be one allowed by the spell. Finally, for 1 round following the use of this ability, the dragon can control any new fire spell cast within its area of control, as if it were the caster. It can make all decisions allowed to the caster, including canceling the spell if it so desires. </p><p><b>Melt Stone (Su)</b> The dragon can use its breath weapon to melt rock at a range of 100 feet, affecting a 55-foot-radius area. The area becomes lava to a depth of 1 foot. Any creature in contact with the lava takes 20d6 points of fire damage on the first round, 10d6 on the second, and none thereafter as the lava hardens and cools. If used on a wall or ceiling, treat this ability as an avalanche that deals fire damage.</p> <p/><p><b>Mythic Rating</b> 10</p> <p>Few creatures inspire such dread as the magnificently wrathful red dragons, and the ones with mythic power are even more fearful. They are the embodiments of destruction, hatred, and draconic arrogance. Magnificent and utterly frightening to behold, mythic red dragons possess a fierce beauty that exceeds all other dragons. From their powerful jaws, capable of snapping iron bars and the masts of ships, to their muscular tails, which can crash through stone walls as easily as whips break skin, red dragons reflect predatory superiority and murderous perfection. A mythic red dragon's body has cordlike muscles that allow it to move more quickly and gracefully than a creature of its size should have a right to.</p> <p>Villains of the worst kind, mythic red dragons are unflinchingly evil in ways rarely matched even by other mythic evil creatures. Their destructive impulses and wrathful fiery rampages surprise and delight the most heinous demons. These legendary dragons demand annual royal sacrifices or tribute in slaves, and think nothing of working their underlings to death.</p> <p>An older mythic red dragon spends little time out of its lair, and when it does emerge it prefers to attack humanoid settlements away from the immediate vicinity, burning down buildings, dropping peasants from great heights, and demanding coins and other treasures. This raiding pattern makes it difficult for would-be dragonslayers to find the creature's actual lair.</p> <p>Mythic red dragons use their magic to protect their lairs with a variety of protective spells. A typical lair also contains slave-built mundane traps, environmental hazards such as steam vents poisonous fumes, and (if within an active volcano) molten rock as part of its defenses.</p> </text> <token type="token">tokens/Dragon, Red (Mythic Wyrm).png@mythicmonsters</token> </DragonRed-MythicWyrm> <DragonWhite-MythicJuvenile> <listlink type="windowreference"> <class>npc</class> <recordname>..</recordname> </listlink> <name type="string">Dragon, White (Mythic Juvenile)</name> <type type="string">CE Medium dragon (cold, mythic)</type> <aura type="string"/> <hd type="string">9d12+66</hd> <speed type="string">60 ft., burrow 30 ft., fly 150 ft.

The save DC is Constitution-based. </p><p><b>Fire Vortex (Su)</b> A mythic fire giant can expend one use of mythic power to create a vortex of fire within 30 feet. The vortex is 5 feet wide at its base, 15 feet wide at the top, and 30 feet tall. Any creature starting its turn adjacent to the vortex takes 6d6 points of fire damage, and any creature passing through it takes 15d6 fire damage.

It must be flying downward at an angle of 45 degrees or steeper to use this ability.</p> <p/><p><b>Mythic Rating</b> 3</p> <p>A mythic griffon is a superior specimen-perhaps augmented by magic, blessed by a nature goddess, or the descendant of an exceptional line of mighty griffons dating back to the first of its kind. Stronger and faster than other griffons, it is aware of its superiority (even though it is no more intelligent than a non-mythic griffon) and will only consent to a truly heroic rider who respects it as an equal rather than as a mere steed.</p> <p>If approached by a suitable rider, a mythic griffon is no more difficult to train than a non-mythic griffon. The eggs of a mythic griffon usually sell for twice as much as those of a common griffon, though there is no way to tell if a particular hatchling is mythic until it is several weeks or months old. Mythic griffons are extremely protective of their mates, eggs, and offspring, and may spend the rest of their lives in the search for vengeance against thieves or murderers-even working with lesser beings as allies or riders.</p> <p>A mythic griffon who cannot find a suitable griffon mate may consort with unicorns, awakened horses, or mythic horses or unicorns. The offspring of such unions is usually a hippogriff, but in rare cases is a mythic hippogriff. Because of prejudice against a hippogriff's animal-level intelligence, a mythic griffon usually leaves its offspring once they are grown.</p> <p>A mythic griffon can carry up to 400 pounds as a light load, 800 pounds as a medium load, and 1,200 pounds as a heavy load.</p> </text> <token type="token">tokens/Griffon (Mythic).png@mythicmonsters</token> </Griffon-Mythic> <HellHound-Mythic> <listlink type="windowreference"> <class>npc</class> <recordname>..</recordname> </listlink> <name type="string">Hell Hound (Mythic)</name> <type type="string">LE Medium outsider (evil, extraplanar, fire, lawful, mythic)</type> <aura type="string"/> <hd type="string">5d10+20</hd> <speed type="string">40 ft.</speed> <ac type="string">17, touch 11, flat-footed 16 (+1 Dex, +6 natural)</ac> <babgrp type="string">Base Atk +5; CMB +7; CMD 18 (22 vs. trip)</babgrp> <atk type="string">bite +9 (2d6+3 plus burn)</atk> <fullatk type="string">bite +9 (2d6+3 plus burn)</fullatk> <spacereach type="string">5ft./5ft.</spacereach> <specialattacks type="string">breath weapon (10-ft. cone, 2d6 fire plus clinging flames, Reflex DC 14 half, usable every 1d4 rounds), burn (1d6, DC 14), mythic power (1/day, surge +1d6)</specialattacks> <senses type="string">darkvision 60 ft., scent; Perception +8</senses> <specialqualities type="string">DR 5/epic; Immune fire; Weaknesses vulnerability to cold</specialqualities> <skills type="string">Acrobatics +9 (+13 when jumping), Perception +8, Stealth +14, Survival +8; Racial Modifiers +5 Stealth</skills> <feats type="string">Improved Initiative, Run, Weapon Focus (bite)M</feats> <environment type="string">any (Hell)</environment> <organization type="string">solitary, pair, or pack (3-12)</organization> <treasure type="string">incidental</treasure> <alignment type="string">LE</alignment> <strength type="number">15</strength> <dexterity type="number">13</dexterity> <constitution type="number">15</constitution> <intelligence type="number">6</intelligence> <wisdom type="number">10</wisdom> <charisma type="number">6</charisma> <fortitudesave type="number">+6</fortitudesave> <reflexsave type="number">+5</reflexsave> <willsave type="number">+1</willsave> <hp type="number">47</hp> <init type="number">+5</init> <cr type="number">4</cr> <languages type="string">Infernal (can't speak)</languages> <xp type="number">1200</xp> <text type="formattedtext"> <p>This brawny hound is wreathed in flames, and its footsteps leave burning prints that sputter and smoke.</p> <h><u>Special Abilities</u></h><p> <b>Clinging Flames (Ex)</b> A creature that takes damage from a mythic hell hound's breath weapon also catches on fire (using the save DC for its burn ability).</p> <p/><p><b>Mythic Rating</b> 1</p> <p>A mythic hell hound is a prince among the wolves of Hell, feral but still subservient to the archdevils.

This fast healing applies only to damage dealt to the hydra's body. </p><p><b>Hydra Traits (Ex)</b> A mythic hydra can be killed by severing all of its heads or slaying its body. Any attack that is not an attempt to sever a head affects the body, including area attacks or attacks that cause piercing or bludgeoning damage. To sever a head, an opponent must make a sunder attempt with a slashing weapon targeting a head. A head is considered a separate weapon with hardness 0 and hit points equal to the hydra's Hit Dice. To sever a head, an opponent must deal enough damage to reduce the head's hit points to 0 or fewer. Severing a head deals damage to the hydra's body equal to the hydra's current Hit Dice. A hydra can't attack with a severed head, but takes no other penalties. </p><p><b>Regenerate Head (Ex)</b> When a mythic hydra's head is destroyed, two heads regrow in 1d4 rounds. A mythic hydra can't have more than twice its original number of heads at any one time. To prevent new heads from growing, at least 5 points of acid or fire damage must be dealt to the stump (a touch attack to hit) before they appear. Acid or fire damage from area attacks can affect stumps and the body simultaneously. A hydra doesn't die from losing heads until all its heads are cut off and the stumps are seared by acid or fire.</p> <p/><p><b>Mythic Rating</b> 3</p> <p>A mythic hydra is a deadly combination of bites, lunges, speed, and durability.

The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.\r\r1st Round: Presence or absence of magical auras.\r\r2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.\r\r3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (arcana) skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a nonspell effect.) If the aura emanates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its properties (see Spellcraft).\r\rMagical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.\r\rAura Strength: An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.\r\r\r | Spell or Object | Aura Power \r\r | Faint | Moderate | Strong | Overwhelming \r\r | Functioning spell (spell level) | 3rd or lower | 4th-6th | 7th-9th | 10th+ (deity-level) \r\r | Magic item (caster level) | 5th or lower | 6th-11th | 12th-20th | 21st+ (artifact)\r\r Lingering Aura: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power: \r\r | Original Strength | Duration of Lingering Aura \r\r | Faint | 1d6 rounds \r\r | Moderate | 1d6 minutes \r\r | Strong | 1d6x10 minutes \r\r | Overwhelming | 1d6 days\r\r Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell registers.

If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so.\r\rItems dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible.\r\rOf course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as swimming in water or stepping in a puddle). If a check is required, a stationary invisible creature has a +40 bonus on its Stealth checks. This bonus is reduced to +20 if the creature is moving. The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions. Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear.\r\rSpells such as bless that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.\r\rInvisibility can be made permanent (on objects only) with a permanency spell.  </description></id-00002></spells> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level2> <level3> <level type="number">3</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells idcounter="2"><id-00001> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">1</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Haste</name> <school type="string">transmutation</school> <level type="string">alchemist 3, bard 3, magus 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner 2</level> <components type="string">V, S, M (a shaving of licorice root)</components> <castingtime type="string">1 standard action</castingtime> <range type="string">close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</range> <effect type="string"> one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart</effect> <duration type="string">1 round/level</duration> <save type="string">Fortitude negates (harmless)</save> <sr type="string">yes (harmless)</sr> <shortdescription type="string">One creature/level moves faster, receives +1 on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">The transmuted creatures move and act more quickly than normal.

A hasted creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves.

A lamia matriarch that gains mythic power gains the mythic lamia's aura of seduction, a tail slap attack, grab, and constrict. She increases her sorcerer caster level to 8th and usually learns spells that aid her minions, such as freedom of movement and rage. She may use her touch attack to drain Wisdom or drain one use of mythic power from the target and regain one of her own uses of mythic power (save negates).</p> </text> <token type="token">tokens/Lamia (Mythic).png@mythicmonsters</token> </Lamia-Mythic> <Lich-Mythic> <listlink type="windowreference"> <class>npc</class> <recordname>..</recordname> </listlink> <name type="string">Lich (Mythic)</name> <type type="string">LE Medium undead (augmented humanoid, human, mythic)</type> <aura type="string">Aura fear (60 ft., DC 28)</aura> <hd type="string">13d8+147</hd> <speed type="string">30 ft.</speed> <ac type="string">36, touch 14, flat-footed 34 (+7 armor, +2 deflection, +2 Dex, +15 natural)</ac> <babgrp type="string">Base Atk +9; CMB +8; CMD 22</babgrp> <atk type="string">+1 heavy mace +9 (1d8) or touch +3 (1d8+6 plus paralyzing touch)</atk> <fullatk type="string">+1 heavy mace +9/+4 (1d8) and  touch +3 (1d8+6 plus paralyzing touch)</fullatk> <spacereach type="string">5ft./5ft.</spacereach> <specialattacks type="string">channel negative energy 10/day (DC 23, 7d6), hand of the acolyte (11/day), inspired spell, mythic power (7/day, surge +1d10), mythic spells 2/day, paralyzing touch (DC 28), scythe of evil (6 rounds, 2/day) Domain</specialattacks> <senses type="string">darkvision 60 ft., spell perception; Perception +29</senses> <specialqualities type="string">channel resistance +8, creeping paralysis; DR 15/bludgeoning and epic and magic; Immune cold, electricity, undead traits; SR 32; mythic phylactery, rejuvenation Combat Gear</specialqualities> <skills type="string">Heal +16, Intimidate +18, Knowledge (arcana, religion) +18, Perception +29, Sense Motive +27, Spellcraft +26, Stealth +9; Racial Modifiers +8 Perception, +8 Sense Motive, +8 Spellcraft, +8 Stealth</skills> <feats type="string">Combat Casting, Craft Wondrous Item, Extra Channel, Improved ChannelM, Improved InitiativeM, Iron Will, Mythic Spell LoreB, Spell Focus (necromancy)M, ToughnessM</feats> <environment type="string">any</environment> <organization type="string">solitary</organization> <treasure type="string">NPC gear (potions of invisibility [2], +3 chain shirt, +1 heavy mace, amulet of natural armor +3, belt of incredible dexterity +2, cloak of resistance +3, headband of mental prowess +4 [Wis, Cha], ring of protection +2, other treasure)</treasure> <alignment type="string">LE</alignment> <strength type="number">8</strength> <dexterity type="number">14</dexterity> <constitution type="number">-</constitution> <intelligence type="number">15</intelligence> <wisdom type="number">26</wisdom> <charisma type="number">20</charisma> <fortitudesave type="number">+16</fortitudesave> <reflexsave type="number">+9</reflexsave> <willsave type="number">+21</willsave> <hp type="number">209</hp> <init type="number">+13M</init> <cr type="number">17</cr> <languages type="string">Abyssal, Common</languages> <spellmode type="string">preparation</spellmode> <spellset> <id-00001> <cc> <misc type="number">0</misc> </cc> <cl type="number">13</cl> <dc> <ability type="string">wisdom</ability> </dc> <label type="string">Cleric</label> <levels> <level0> <level type="number">0</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells idcounter="6"><id-00001> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">1</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Bleed</name> <school type="string">necromancy</school> <level type="string">cleric 0, sorcerer/wizard 0, witch 0, inquisitor 0</level> <components type="string">V, S</components> <castingtime type="string">1 standard action</castingtime> <range type="string">close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</range> <effect type="string"> one living creature</effect> <duration type="string">instantaneous</duration> <save type="string">Will negates</save> <sr type="string">yes</sr> <shortdescription type="string">Cause a stabilized creature to resume dying.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">You cause a living creature that is below 0 hit points but stabilized to resume dying.

If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power: \r\r | Original Strength | Duration of Lingering Aura \r\r | Faint | 1d6 rounds \r\r | Moderate | 1d6 minutes \r\r | Strong | 1d6x10 minutes \r\r | Overwhelming | 1d6 days\r\r Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell registers.

A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect.\r\rYou choose to use dispel magic in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell.\r\rTargeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell's caster level). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell.\r\rFor example, a 7th-level caster casts dispel magic, targeting a creature affected by stoneskin (caster level 12th) and fly (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the stoneskin (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the fly (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the stoneskin would have been dispelled, leaving the fly intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected.\r\rYou can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a wall of fire). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect.\r\rIf you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.\r\rIf the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level (DC = 11 + the item's caster level). If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.\r\rYou automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.\r\rCounterspell: When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.  </description></id-00002> <id-00003> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">1</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Invisibility Purge</name> <school type="string">evocation</school> <level type="string">cleric 3, inquisitor 3</level> <components type="string">V, S</components> <castingtime type="string">1 standard action</castingtime> <range type="string">personal</range> <effect type="string"> you</effect> <duration type="string">1 min./level</duration> <save type="string"/> <sr type="string"/> <shortdescription type="string">Dispels invisibility within 5 ft./level.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">You surround yourself with a sphere of power with a radius of 5 feet per caster level that negates all forms of invisibility.\r\rAnything invisible becomes visible while in the area.  </description></id-00003> <id-00004> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">1</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Meld into Stone</name> <school type="string">transmutation[earth]</school> <level type="string">cleric 3, druid 3</level> <components type="string">V, S, DF</components> <castingtime type="string">1 standard action</castingtime> <range type="string">personal</range> <effect type="string"> you</effect> <duration type="string">10 min./level</duration> <save type="string"/> <sr type="string"/> <shortdescription type="string">You and your gear merge with stone.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">Meld into stone enables you to meld your body and possessions into a single block of stone.

Minor physical damage to the stone does not harm you, but its partial destruction (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. The stone's complete destruction expels you and slays you instantly unless you make a DC 18 Fortitude save. Even if you make your save, you still take 5d6 points of damage.\r\rAny time before the duration expires, you can step out of the stone through the surface that you entered. If the spell's duration expires or the effect is dispelled before you voluntarily exit the stone, you are violently expelled and take 5d6 points of damage.\r\rThe following spells harm you if cast upon the stone that you are occupying. Stone to flesh expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. Stone shape deals 3d6 points of damage but does not expel you. Transmute rock to mud expels you and then slays you instantly unless you make a DC 18 Fortitude save, in which case you are merely expelled.

The space within this barrier is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities.\r\rLikewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines.\r\rAn antimagic field suppresses any spell or magical effect used within, brought into, or cast into the area, but does not dispel it.\r\rTime spent within an antimagic field counts against the suppressed spell's duration.\r\rSummoned creatures of any type wink out if they enter an antimagic field. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the conjuration that is maintaining the creature. If you cast antimagic field in an area occupied by a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the creature's spell resistance to make it wink out.\r\r(The effects of instantaneous conjurations are not affected by an antimagic field because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result.) A normal creature can enter the area, as can normal missiles.\r\rFurthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals, undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures' spell-like or supernatural abilities may be temporarily nullified by the field.\r\rDispel magic does not remove the field.\r\rTwo or more antimagic fields sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as wall of force, prismatic sphere, and prismatic wall, remain unaffected by antimagic field.\r\rArtifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.\r\rShould a creature be larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, any part of it that lies outside the barrier is unaffected by the field.  </description></id-00001></spells> <totalcast type="number">0</totalcast> <totalprepared type="number">0</totalprepared> </level6> <level7> <level type="number">7</level> <maxprepared type="number">0</maxprepared> <spells idcounter="4"><id-00001> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">1</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Blasphemy</name> <school type="string">evocation[evil, sonic]</school> <level type="string">cleric 7, inquisitor 6</level> <components type="string">V</components> <castingtime type="string">1 standard action</castingtime> <range type="string">40 ft.</range> <effect type="string">nonevil creatures in a 40-ft.-radius spread centered on you</effect> <duration type="string">instantaneous</duration> <save type="string">Will partial</save> <sr type="string">yes</sr> <shortdescription type="string">Kills, paralyzes, weakens, or dazes nonevil subjects.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">Any nonevil creature within the area of a blasphemy spell suffers the following ill effects.\r\r \r\r | HD | Effect \r\r | Equal to caster level | Dazed \r\r | Up to caster level -1 | Weakened, dazed \r\r | Up to caster level -5 | Paralyzed, weakened, dazed \r\rThe effects are cumulative and concurrent.

As an insubstantial creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures. An ethereal creature can see and hear on the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and ephemeral.

A mythic lich uses the base lich's stats and abilities except as noted here.</p> <p><b>Mythic Subtype:</b> A mythic lich gains the mythic subtype, with a rank equal to half the CR of the base lich. A mythic lich gains additional abilities depending on the base lich's CR instead of the mythic abilities it would get for having a rank. The mythic lich gains all other benefits of having the mythic subtype: ability score bonuses, bonus hit points, mythic feats, mythic power, natural armor bonus, and spell resistance increase (if any).</p> <p><b>CR:</b> Adjust the base lich's CR according to its mythic rank (this template doesn't increase the base lich's CR other than from the mythic rank). Note that a mythic lich's abilities on Table 6-1 depend on the base lich's CR, not the final CR of the mythic lich.</p> <p><b>Tier:</b> A lich with mythic tiers that becomes a mythic lich loses its tiers (and all abilities from those tiers) and gains abilities from the mythic lich template, according to the base lich's CR.</p> <p><b>Channel Resistance (Su):</b> A mythic lich's channel resistance increases to +8. At 8th tier, it increases to +12. At 10th rank, the lich becomes immune to channeled energy from non-mythic sources (except when used to heal undead).</p> <p><b>Creeping Paralysis (Su):</b> A creature that strikes a mythic lich with a natural weapon, unarmed strike, or non-reach manufactured weapon, or otherwise touches the lich must save or be affected by the lich's paralyzing touch ability. This triggers only once per round per creature.</p> <p><b>Mythic Phylactery (Su):</b> A mythic lich's phylactery can't be harmed by non-mythic sources. At 8th rank, the phylactery becomes a minor artifact, and can be destroyed by only one specific method.</p> <p><b>Mythic Potency (Su):</b> A mythic lich adds its rank to the save DCs for its fear aura and paralyzing touch abilities.</p> <p><b>Mythic Spells (Su):</b> A mythic lich gains Mythic Spell Lore as a bonus feat. The lich has a pool of magical power it can draw upon for casting mythic spells. Up to twice per day, it can use this power to cast a mythic spell without expending any uses of mythic power.</p> <p><b>Spell Resistance (Su):</b> A mythic lich gains spell resistance equal to 11 + the base lich's CR (before adding the lich's mythic rank to its SR from the mythic subtype).</p> <p><b>Augmented Spellcasting (Su):</b> At 7th rank, a mythic lich selects one of the following archmage or hierophant abilities: arcane surge, inspired spell, recalled blessing, or wild arcana. Once chosen, this selection can't be changed.</p> <p><b>Spell Perception (Su):</b> At 7th rank, a mythic lich automatically notices spellcasting within 60 feet. The lich automatically pinpoints the location of the caster, identifies the spell being cast, and knows the intended target or area of the spell.</p> <p><b>Immediate Counterspell (Su):</b> At 8th rank, a mythic lich can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to attempt to counter a spell. The lich must use a spell, spell slot, or dispel magic to counterspell as normal. This ability allows the lich to counterspell without first readying an action.</p> <p><b>Enhanced Spellcasting (Su):</b> At 9th rank, a mythic lich gains the ability to treat its 1st-level spells like cantrips or orisons. If the mythic lich is a spontaneous caster, its 1st-level spells known don't consume spell slots and can be used again. If the mythic lich prepares spells, its 1st-level spell slots aren't expended when cast and can be used again. Using metamagic feats or other abilities that alter the spell slot of a spell aren't affected by this ability (for example, a quickened magic missile uses a 5th-level spell slot and is expended when cast).</p> <p><b>Sustained by Magic (Su):</b> At 9th rank, each time a mythic lich casts a spell it regains hit points equal to three times the level of the spell slot used to cast the spell.</p> <p><b>Formidable Animation (Su):</b> At 10th rank, a mythic lich gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws. Any opponent attempting a dispel check against an effect on the lich rolls twice and uses the lower result. Anytime the lich attempts a dispel check, it rolls twice and uses the higher result.</p> <table> <tr><td colspan="5">Mythic Lich Abilities</td></tr> <tr><td>Base Lich's CR</td><td>Mythic Rank</td><td colspan="3">Mythic Abilities</td></tr> <tr><td>12-13</td><td>6th</td><td colspan="3">Channel resistance +8, creeping paralysis, mythic phylactery, mythic potency, mythic spells, spell resistance</td></tr> <tr><td>14-15</td><td>7th</td><td colspan="3">Augmented spellcasting, spell perception</td></tr> <tr><td>16-17</td><td>8th</td><td colspan="3">Channel resistance +12, immediate counterspell</td></tr> <tr><td>18-19</td><td>9th</td><td colspan="3">Enhanced spellcasting, sustained by magic</td></tr> <tr><td>20+</td><td>10th</td><td colspan="3">Channel resistance (immunity), formidable animation</td></tr></table> </text> <token type="token">tokens/Lich (Mythic).png@mythicmonsters</token> </Lich-Mythic> <Manticore-Mythic> <listlink type="windowreference"> <class>npc</class> <recordname>..</recordname> </listlink> <name type="string">Manticore (Mythic)</name> <type type="string">LE Large magical beast (mythic)</type> <aura type="string"/> <hd type="string">6d10+44</hd> <speed type="string">30 ft., fly 50 ft.

A flying creature must escape on its turn or plummet to the ground. As a swift action, a mythic manticore can expend one use of mythic power to skewer all targets hit by its spikes that turn, even if the attacks weren't critical hits. </p><p><b>Spikes (Ex)</b> With a snap of its tail, a mythic manticore can loose a volley of four spikes as a standard action (make an attack roll for each spike).

The creature can launch only 24 spikes in any 24-hour period.</p> <p/><p><b>Mythic Rating</b> 2</p> <p>A mythic manticore is a nightmarish creature, perhaps the result of crossbreeding with poisonous drakes, decadent sphinxes, or aberrant chimeras. A voracious eater, a mythic manticore may devour an entire corpse, as well as its weapons and armor, leaving nothing but a bloody stain on the ground and a few organs it finds unpalatable. Any metal bits it eats are digested and used to grow its deadly spikes. Some are known to dine on giant venomous snakes and spiders with the intent of making their poison even more powerful.</p> <p>A mythic manticore uses its thrown spikes to hold prey in place from a distance so it can leap upon it and tear it apart.

In addition, whenever the minotaur must make a saving throw while inside its lair, it can roll twice and take the higher result. A mythic minotaur can change its lair once per week.

Once created to punish to those who disobey or circumvent the orders of the gods, they use their innate magic to imprison, stalk, and consume humanoids-especially the descendants of the royal line whose blasphemy inspired the creation of this new race. Some mythic minotaurs are worshiped as demigods by primitive or fear-stricken humanoids, and accept sacrifices of young men and women to sate their hunger. They usually have custom armor and weapons appropriate for their large, inhuman frames, offered as gifts by worshipers or made by enslaved blacksmiths.</p> </text> <token type="token">tokens/Minotaur (Mythic).png@mythicmonsters</token> </Minotaur-Mythic> <Mummy-Mythic> <listlink type="windowreference"> <class>npc</class> <recordname>..</recordname> </listlink> <name type="string">Mummy (Mythic)</name> <type type="string">LE Medium undead (mythic)</type> <aura type="string">Aura despair (30 ft., paralyzed for 1d4 rounds, Will DC 16 negates)</aura> <hd type="string">8d8+56 fast healing 5</hd> <speed type="string">20 ft.</speed> <ac type="string">23, touch 10, flat-footed 23 (+13 natural)</ac> <babgrp type="string">Base Atk +6; CMB +14; CMD 24</babgrp> <atk type="string">slam +15 (1d8+12 plus mummy rot)</atk> <fullatk type="string">slam +15 (1d8+12 plus mummy rot)</fullatk> <spacereach type="string">5ft./5ft.</spacereach> <specialattacks type="string">create spawn, mythic power (3/day, surge +1d6)</specialattacks> <senses type="string">darkvision 60 ft.; Perception +16</senses> <specialqualities type="string">DR 5/-; Immune undead traits; Weaknesses vulnerability to fire; change shape (any humanoid; alter self), desert mastery</specialqualities> <skills type="string">Perception +16, Stealth +11</skills> <feats type="string">Power AttackM, Skill Focus (Perception), ToughnessM, Weapon Focus (slam)</feats> <environment type="string">any</environment> <organization type="string">solitary, warden squad (2-6), or guardian detail (7-12)</organization> <treasure type="string">standard</treasure> <alignment type="string">LE</alignment> <strength type="number">26</strength> <dexterity type="number">10</dexterity> <constitution type="number">-</constitution> <intelligence type="number">6</intelligence> <wisdom type="number">15</wisdom> <charisma type="number">15</charisma> <fortitudesave type="number">+4</fortitudesave> <reflexsave type="number">+2</reflexsave> <willsave type="number">+8</willsave> <hp type="number">92</hp> <init type="number">+0</init> <cr type="number">7</cr> <languages type="string">Common</languages> <xp type="number">3200</xp> <text type="formattedtext"> <p>This regal mummy reeks of preservative spices and wears the clothing and jewelry of a wealthy pharaoh.</p> <h><u>Special Abilities</u></h><p> <b>Create Spawn (Su)</b> As a swift action, a mythic mummy can expend one use of mythic power to transform a slain opponent into a non-mythic mummy with the advanced simple template.

The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.\r\r1st Round: Presence or absence of magical auras.\r\r2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.\r\r3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (arcana) skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a nonspell effect.) If the aura emanates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its properties (see Spellcraft).\r\rMagical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.\r\rAura Strength: An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.\r\r\r | Spell or Object | Aura Power \r\r | Faint | Moderate | Strong | Overwhelming \r\r | Functioning spell (spell level) | 3rd or lower | 4th-6th | 7th-9th | 10th+ (deity-level) \r\r | Magic item (caster level) | 5th or lower | 6th-11th | 12th-20th | 21st+ (artifact)\r\r Lingering Aura: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura).

The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.\r\r1st Round: Presence or absence of magical auras.\r\r2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.\r\r3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (arcana) skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a nonspell effect.) If the aura emanates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its properties (see Spellcraft).\r\rMagical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.\r\rAura Strength: An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.\r\r\r | Spell or Object | Aura Power \r\r | Faint | Moderate | Strong | Overwhelming \r\r | Functioning spell (spell level) | 3rd or lower | 4th-6th | 7th-9th | 10th+ (deity-level) \r\r | Magic item (caster level) | 5th or lower | 6th-11th | 12th-20th | 21st+ (artifact)\r\r Lingering Aura: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power: \r\r | Original Strength | Duration of Lingering Aura \r\r | Faint | 1d6 rounds \r\r | Moderate | 1d6 minutes \r\r | Strong | 1d6x10 minutes \r\r | Overwhelming | 1d6 days\r\r Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell registers. Each round, you can turn to detect magic in a new area.

The noise a ghost sound spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from 16 humans, while a roaring dragon is equal to the noise from 32 humans.

The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.\r\r1st Round: Presence or absence of magical auras.\r\r2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.\r\r3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (arcana) skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a nonspell effect.) If the aura emanates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its properties (see Spellcraft).\r\rMagical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.\r\rAura Strength: An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.\r\r\r | Spell or Object | Aura Power \r\r | Faint | Moderate | Strong | Overwhelming \r\r | Functioning spell (spell level) | 3rd or lower | 4th-6th | 7th-9th | 10th+ (deity-level) \r\r | Magic item (caster level) | 5th or lower | 6th-11th | 12th-20th | 21st+ (artifact)\r\r Lingering Aura: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power: \r\r | Original Strength | Duration of Lingering Aura \r\r | Faint | 1d6 rounds \r\r | Moderate | 1d6 minutes \r\r | Strong | 1d6x10 minutes \r\r | Overwhelming | 1d6 days\r\r Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell registers.

The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.\r\rDetect magic can be made permanent with a permanency spell.  </description></id-00001> <id-00002> <parse type="number">1</parse> <prepared type="number">1</prepared> <cast type="number">0</cast> <name type="string">Read Magic (constant)</name> <school type="string">divination</school> <level type="string">bard 0, cleric 0, druid 0, paladin 1, ranger 1, sorcerer/wizard 0, summoner 0, witch 0, inquisitor 0, magus 0</level> <components type="string">V, S, F (a clear crystal or mineral prism)</components> <castingtime type="string">1 standard action</castingtime> <range type="string">personal</range> <effect type="string"> you</effect> <duration type="string">10 min./level</duration> <save type="string"/> <sr type="string"/> <shortdescription type="string">Read scrolls and spellbooks.</shortdescription> <source type="string">PFRPG Core</source> <description type="string">You can decipher magical inscriptions on objects-books, scrolls, weapons, and the like-that would otherwise be unintelligible.

A mythic vampire uses the base vampire's stats and abilities except as noted here.</p> <p><b>Mythic Subtype:</b> A mythic vampire gains the mythic subtype, with a rank equal to half the CR of the base vampire. A mythic vampire gains additional abilities depending on the base vampire's CR instead of the mythic abilities it would get for having a rank. The mythic vampire gains all other benefits of having the mythic subtype: ability score bonuses, bonus hit points, mythic feats, mythic power, natural armor bonus, and spell resistance increase (if any).</p> <p><b>CR:</b> Adjust the base vampire's CR according to its mythic rank (this template doesn't increase the base vampire's CR other than from the mythic rank). Note that a mythic vampire's abilities on Table 6-2 depend on the base vampire's CR, not the final CR of the mythic vampire.</p> <p><b>Tier:</b> A vampire with mythic tiers that becomes a mythic vampire loses its tiers (and all abilities from those tiers) and gains abilities from the mythic vampire template, according to the base vampire's CR.</p> <p><b>Negative Energy Focus (Su):</b> A mythic vampire's energy drain ability triggers once per successful melee attack with melee weapons or natural attacks, up to a maximum of once per round for every 2 mythic ranks the vampire has.</p> <p><b>Overcome Weakness:</b> If a mythic vampire begins its turn in an area of direct sunlight, it is nauseated (rather than staggered), takes 10 points of damage, and loses its fast healing ability for that round. The vampire is still destroyed on the second round. At higher ranks, it can overcome or ignore other vampire weaknesses or aversions, as follows: garlic (4th rank), mirrors and holy symbols (6th rank), invitation (8th rank), running water (10th rank).</p> <p><b>Scabrous Claws (Su):</b> As an immediate action, a mythic vampire can expend one use of mythic power to grow claws on its hands, allowing it to make claw attacks or slam attacks. The claw attacks deal the same damage as its slams (including energy drain) plus 1d6 points of bleed damage. The claws last for 1 hour or until dismissed by the vampire as a free action.</p> <p><b>Channel Resistance (Su):</b> At 3rd rank, a mythic vampire's channel resistance increases to +8. At 6th rank, it increases to +12. At 9th rank, it increases to +16.</p> <p><b>Children of the Eclipse (Su):</b> At 4th rank, a mythic vampire can use its children of the night ability to call forth bat swarms, rat swarms, or wolves once per hour instead of once per day. Once per day, the mythic vampire can use children of the night to call forth 2d6 ghouls or 1d6+1 shadows. At 7th rank, once per day the mythic vampire can use children of the night to call forth 1d6 wraiths or mohrgs.</p> <p><b>Mist Shapes (Su):</b> At 5th rank, a mythic vampire can summon and sculpt mist into realistic shapes as the major image spell. A shape created in this way lasts for as long as the mythic vampire can see and concentrate upon it. In areas of particularly dense mist, this ability functions as mirage arcana instead of major image.</p> <p><b>Mastermind (Su):</b> At 6th rank, as a standard action a mythic vampire can see, hear, and speak through the body of a creature it has dominated. The mythic vampire can use this ability indefinitely on one creature at a time, as long as it and the creature under its control remain on the same plane. A mythic vampire using this ability can't move, but is still aware of its surroundings and can end this ability as a free action.</p> <p><b>Telekinesis (Sp):</b> At 6th rank, a mythic vampire can expend one use of mythic power to use the spell telekinesis with a caster level equal to the mythic vampire's CR.</p> <p><b>Flight (Su):</b> At 7th rank, a mythic vampire can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to gain a fly speed equal to double its base speed (perfect maneuverability) for 1 hour. When it activates this ability, the vampire chooses whether to manifest bat-like wings or to float unnaturally. If it manifests wings, it gains a bonus on Intimidate checks equal to its rank. If it chooses to float, it gains a bonus on Stealth checks equal to its rank.</p> <p><b>Create Mythic Spawn:</b> At 8th rank, a mythic vampire can expend one use of mythic power when using create spawn to cause the victim to rise as undead in 1 hour instead of 1d4 days. The mythic vampire can expend two uses of mythic power when using create spawn to create a mythic vampire instead of a vampire spawn or non-mythic vampire.</p> <p><b>Blood Omen (Su):</b> At 9th rank, a mythic vampire can expend two uses of mythic power as a standard action to drain blood from all creatures within 30 feet. Each creature must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the vampire's HD + the vampire's Cha modifier) or be affected by the vampire's blood drain ability. The mythic vampire gains the normal benefits of all blood drained in this manner.</p> <p><b>Eclipse (Su):</b> At 10th rank, a mythic vampire can expend one use of its mythic power to blot out the power of the sun in a 1-mile radius. This entire area is affected by the spell deeper darkness for 1 hour. The mythic vampire's can see through this darkness.</p> <table><tr><td colspan="5">Mythic Vampire Abilities</td></tr> <tr><td>Base Vampire's CR</td><td>Mythic Rank</td><td colspan="3">Mythic Abilities</td></tr> <tr><td>4-5</td><td>2nd</td><td colspan="3">Negative energy focus, overcome weakness (sunlight), scabrous claws</td></tr> <tr><td>6-7</td><td>3rd</td><td colspan="3">Channel resistance +8</td></tr> <tr><td>8-9</td><td>4th</td><td colspan="3">Children of the eclipse (ghouls or shadows), overcome weakness (garlic)</td></tr> <tr><td>10-11</td><td>5th</td><td colspan="3">Mist shapes</td></tr> <tr><td>12-13</td><td>6th</td><td colspan="3">Channel resistance +12, mastermind, overcome weakness (mirrors and holy symbols), telekinesis</td></tr> <tr><td>14-15</td><td>7th</td><td colspan="3">Children of the eclipse (wraiths or mohrgs), flight</td></tr> <tr><td>16-17</td><td>8th</td><td colspan="3">Create mythic spawn, overcome weakness (invitation)</td></tr> <tr><td>18-19</td><td>9th</td><td colspan="3">Blood omen, channel resistance +16</td></tr> <tr><td>20+</td><td>10th</td><td colspan="3">Eclipse, overcome weakness (running water)</td></tr></table> </text> <token type="token">tokens/Vampire (Mythic).png@mythicmonsters</token> </Vampire-Mythic> <Worg-Mythic> <listlink type="windowreference"> <class>npc</class> <recordname>..</recordname> </listlink> <name type="string">Worg (Mythic)</name> <type type="string">NE Medium magical beast (mythic)</type> <aura type="string">Aura darkness (30 ft., 1 step)</aura> <hd type="string">4d10+14</hd> <speed type="string">50 ft.</speed> <ac type="string">15, touch 12, flat-footed 13 (+2 Dex, +3 natural)</ac> <babgrp type="string">Base Atk +4; CMB +7; CMD 19 (23 vs. trip)</babgrp> <atk type="string">bite +7 (1d8+4 plus trip)</atk> <fullatk type="string">bite +7 (1d8+4 plus trip)</fullatk> <spacereach type="string">5ft./5ft.</spacereach> <specialattacks type="string">fear cone (30 ft., DC 12), mythic power (1/day, surge +1d6)</specialattacks> <senses type="string">darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision, scent; Perception +11</senses> <specialqualities type="string"/> <skills type="string">Perception +11, Stealth +9, Survival +5; Racial Modifiers +2 Perception, +2 Stealth, +2 Survival</skills> <feats type="string">Run, Skill Focus (Perception)M</feats> <environment type="string">temperate forests and plains</environment> <organization type="string">solitary, pair, or pack (3-11)</organization> <treasure type="string">incidental</treasure> <alignment type="string">NE</alignment> <strength type="number">17</strength> <dexterity type="number">15</dexterity> <constitution type="number">13</constitution> <intelligence type="number">6</intelligence> <wisdom type="number">14</wisdom> <charisma type="number">10</charisma> <fortitudesave type="number">+5</fortitudesave> <reflexsave type="number">+6</reflexsave> <willsave type="number">+3</willsave> <hp type="number">36</hp> <init type="number">+2</init> <cr type="number">3</cr> <languages type="string">Common, Goblin</languages> <xp type="number">800</xp> <text type="formattedtext"> <p>A terrifying darkness surrounds this giant wolf.</p> <h><u>Special Abilities</u></h><p> <b>Darkness Aura (Su)</b> As a free action, a mythic worg can activate its darkness aura, which reduces the light level within 30 feet of it by one step.

<p><i>Mythic Adventures</i> uses several terms that are new to the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, or that previously existed but were rarely used. These terms are worth reviewing before continuing on with the contents in this section.</p>

<p><b>Ascension</b>: The moment of ascension is the moment when a normal character becomes a mythic character. This event is usually a critical moment in the story that helps to define the mythic character's origin and the source of her power. Once a character has undergone ascension, she gains her first mythic tier and can select a mythic path.</p>

<p><b>Boon</b>: When a mythic character completes a particularly difficult task, the GM might reward that character with a boon. A boon represents having earned the favor of the source of the character's power. Once acquired, a boon allows the character to draw upon mythic power one additional time that day. A mythic character might be rewarded with a boon several times in a single session, but no more than once per encounter.</p>

<p><b>DR/Epic</b>: A type of damage reduction, DR/epic can be overcome only by a weapon with an enhancement bonus of +6 or greater. Weapons with special abilities also count as epic for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction if the total bonus value of all of their abilities (including the enhancement bonus) is +6 or greater.</p>

<p><b>Mythic</b>: With abilities seemingly beyond the those of ordinary mortals, a mythic character or mythic monster becomes part of a story that plays out on a greater scale than ordinary people can understand. An attack, spell, or other effect is considered mythic if it originates from a mythic source, such as a character or creature with a mythic tier or rank.</p>

<p><b>Mythic Path</b>: (Often referred to just as a "path.") The theme of a characters mythic abilities is determined by her mythic path&#151;archmage, champion, guardian, hierophant, marshal, or trickster. Each path has a number of special abilities associated with it that the character can select as she advances in tier.</p>

<p><b>Mythic Power</b>: Each mythic character can call upon this base mythic ability to influence destiny and fuel other abilities. At its most basic, mythic power is needed to use the surge ability, but it can also be called upon to use a number of other mythic abilities.</p>

<p><b>Mythic Rank</b>: (Often referred to just as a "rank.") Similar to tiers, mythic ranks are used to describe the approximate mythic power possessed by a monster. All creatures with a mythic rank are considered mythic for the purposes of feats, spells, magic items, and other abilities. Mythic ranks range from 1 to 10.</p>

<p><b>Mythic Tier</b>: (Often referred to just as a "tier.") Mythic characters advance in power by gaining tiers, each of which grants new abilities. Attaining a new mythic tier requires completing difficult trials within the campaign's story rather than accumulating experience points. Mythic tiers range from 1 to 10. Characters who achieve 10th tier are at the height of mythic power, and are in some respects akin to minor deities.</p>

<p><b>Mythic Trial</b>: (Often referred to just as a "trial.") A trial is a difficult task that awaits mythic heroes. It usually represents the culmination of part of the heroes' story, marking it as an important point in their legend. A mythic character has to complete one or more trials in order to reach a new mythic tier. Trials and mythic path advancement are separate from XP and character level advancement, and are based on grand achievements within the story rather than individual encounters.</p>

<p><b>Non-Mythic</b>: Any attack, spell, or effect originating from a character or creature without any mythic abilities is non-mythic. This term can also refer to a character without a mythic tier or a creature without a mythic rank.</p>

<p><b>Surge</b>: Surge is a basic ability that each mythic character receives. It allows her to roll a die and add the result to a d20 roll, influencing the outcome after the results are revealed.</p></text>

    <MythicHeroes>
      <name type="string">Mythic Heroes</name>
      <text type="formattedtext"><h>Mythic Heroes</h>
<p>Mythic heroes are set apart from their contemporaries, capable of amazing feats of courage in the face of overwhelming odds. In spite of this, they're still similar in many ways to other adventurers. They have hit points, an Armor Class, and saving throws&#151;in fact, most of their statistics are comparable to non-mythic characters of an equal level. Where mythic characters differ is in the special abilities they gain from mythic paths&#151;collections of similar abilities that they can choose to represent their mythic power. These abilities enhance mythic characters both in and out of battle, allowing them to take part in extraordinary, larger-than-life adventures.</p>

      <CreatingAMythicCharacter>
        <name type="string">Creating a Mythic Character</name>
        <text type="formattedtext"><h>Creating a Mythic Character</h>
<p>Unlike normal characters, those with mythic power have greater ties to the world around them and a greater place in legend. A skilled fighter might impact the history of a region, but a mythic champion can change its fate, and his every move is chronicled and recorded. Because of this greater impact on the campaign world, creating a mythic character requires you to work with the GM to find your place in the story and determine the source of your power.</p>
<p>To create a mythic character, start by creating a normal character using the standard rules found in the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>. Despite their incredible abilities, mythic characters start with the same class features and abilities as normal ones.</p>
<p>The process by which your character becomes mythic is determined by the shape of the overall campaign. Generally, characters become mythic in one of two ways&#151;either the GM decides to make the characters mythic as one part of the campaign, or their ascension and subsequent deeds are the central focus of the story from nearly the very beginning. Whichever path is chosen influences how you create your mythic character.</p>
<p>If mythic power is added to your character as part of a larger campaign (possibly only for a short period of time), that story defines the source of your newfound power, which is likely the same for all of the PCs. While you might not make all of the decisions about that power's origins and nature, you will still be able to customize your character by selecting your mythic path and abilities.</p>
<p>If mythic power will instead be a central theme of the entire campaign, each PC might have a different, individual source of power. In such a campaign, you should work with your GM to determine the source of your mythic power. This could be anything from contact with an ancient artifact to gaining the sponsorship of a deity. The GM might ask for all of the PCs to share some aspects of their power&#151;such as its source&#151;to give them a common bond, or you might come together as part of a larger destiny, a gathering of great heroes to accomplish truly legendary deeds.</p>
<p>In either case, there will be a moment in the campaign when you gain mythic power (or when it manifests, in the case of mythic power that has been latent in you since birth). This critical part of the story is called the moment of ascension. Depending on the style of the campaign, this could occur very early in the story or much later in your character's career, as part of larger plotline. From this moment onward, your character is mythic, and gains a mythic path and a variety of mythic abilities.</p>
<h>Mythic Ascension</h>
<p>The moment a character gains her first mythic tier is called the moment of ascension (or simply ascension) and is usually concurrent with an extraordinary event. Generally speaking, the GM determines this event, which has many implications on the story of the character. Ascension determines the source of a mythic character's power, and though this doesn't affect the types of abilities she gains, it can influence future choices and roleplaying decisions.</p>
<p>The GM is free to invent any sort of event to serve as the moment of ascension, as required by the needs of the campaign. Running a Mythic Game includes more information for GMs to consider when designing the moment of ascension. The following ideas represent some of the most common means of ascension.</p>
<p><i>Artifact</i>: The character comes into contact with an unstable artifact that unleashes some of its power into her, granting her mythic power. The mythic character might need to protect the artifact, as it is the source of her power.</p>
<p><i>Fated</i>: The character was born under an auspicious sign, such as a planetary conjunction or lunar eclipse, and as such was destined to greatness. The moment of ascension comes when those circumstances repeat themselves and the character gains mythic power.</p>
<p><i>Godling</i>: The mythic character is the child of a god, typically born from the union of that deity and a mortal. The moment of ascension is when the character learns of her true heritage or is visited by her divine parent (or an agent of that deity).</p>
<p><i>Granted</i>: A divine agent or other incredibly powerful being calls upon the character to act as its representative. This role gives the character mythic power, but possibly only while serving the interests of this benefactor and while holding to that patron's tenets.</p>
<p><i>Passed On</i>: The character is present at the death of a powerful&#151;perhaps even mythic&#151;creature. In its final moments, it passes on its power to the character, granting mythic abilities. Alternatively, its power might not be given voluntarily, but rather taken by the PCs when they slaying a mythic creature. These methods could even be the way that all mythic power is gained in a campaign.</p>
<h>Selecting a Path</h>
<p>Once you gain mythic power, you select a mythic path, which is much like an additional class. It determines the majority of your mythic abilities. But instead of gaining levels in a mythic path, you gain tiers that grant additional abilities and bonuses. Gaining a tier in a path doesn't replace gaining experience and character levels. You still receive experience points for defeating challenges, but these apply only to your class levels. You gain additional mythic tiers by completing a number of trials; see Gaining Tiers.</p>
<p>Each path grants a number of specific abilities. In addition, all mythic characters have certain mythic abilities in common (see the Base Mythic Abilities table). As soon as your mythic character achieves a new tier, you must select all of the new powers that come with that tier.</p></text>
      </CreatingAMythicCharacter>
      <MythicPaths>
        <name type="string">Mythic Paths</name>
        <text type="formattedtext"><h>Mythic Paths</h>
<p>Every mythic character belongs to a mythic path. Each path represents a journey into legend, and each tier in that path grants abilities and features related to that pursuit. Upon achieving his 1st mythic tier, a character must choose one mythic path to follow. Characters can choose from the following mythic paths.</p>
<p><link class="referencetextwide" recordname="lists.MythicHeroes.MythicPaths.Archmage"><b>Archmage</b></link>: A master of arcane magic, the archmage casts powerful spells with great skill and ease, and shapes reality at whim. The powers of the archmage allow her to alter her spells, penetrate foes' defenses, and master nearly any subject. While many of the archmage's abilities are most valuable to a character with a high Intelligence score, those with high Charisma scores will also find a wide variety of powerful options. The path of the archmage is suitable for arcane spellcasters.</p>
<p><link class="referencetextwide" recordname="lists.MythicHeroes.MythicPaths.Champion"><b>Champion</b></link>: Unparalleled in combat, the champion stands triumphant on the battlefield, surrounded by bruised and broken foes. The abilities of the champion allow him to deliver strikes more accurately, perform astounding combat maneuvers, and move effortlessly around the battlefield. Characters with a high Strength score will find this path extremely useful, as will those with a high Constitution score. The path of the champion is suitable for characters who rely on martial arms and combat maneuvers.</p>
<p><link class="referencetextwide" recordname="lists.MythicHeroes.MythicPaths.Guardian"><b>Guardian</b></link>: None can get past the impervious guardian&#151;those who threaten this devout hero's charges are doomed to fail. The powers of the guardian allow her to hold her ground, protect her allies, prevent enemies from moving past her, and survive hits that would defeat lesser heroes. Characters that have a high Constitution score and frequently find themselves in the middle of combat gain valuable powers by becoming a guardian. The path of the guardian is suitable for those who routinely sustain massive amounts of damage.</p>
<p><link class="referencetextwide" recordname="lists.MythicHeroes.MythicPaths.Hierophant"><b>Hierophant</b></link>: Drawing on power that goes beyond the gods, the hierophant is an inviolate vessel for the divine. The abilities of the hierophant allow him to enhance the power of his spells, heal others with greater potency, and commune with the gods. Most characters that become hierophants have a high Wisdom score, although many also have an above-average Charisma score. The path of the hierophant is suitable for divine spellcasters.</p>
<p><link class="referencetextwide" recordname="lists.MythicHeroes.MythicPaths.Marshal"><b>Marshal</b></link>: Inspiration and courage make the marshal the greatest leader, capable of leading troops to victory over any challenge. The powers of the marshal allow her to inspire others, which grants bonuses and additional opportunities to all of her comrades. Characters with a high Charisma score and an above-average Intelligence score will gain a variety of useful abilities by becoming marshals. The path of the marshal is suitable for those who continually aid others.</p>
<p><link class="referencetextwide" recordname="lists.MythicHeroes.MythicPaths.Trickster"><b>Trickster</b></link>: Skill, training, and savvy make the trickster the master of the impossible&#151;defying unbeatable obstacles and traps, tricking the wise, and hitting otherwise unattainable targets. The trickster's abilities allow him to change his appearance, manipulate others, and strike with deadly accuracy. Characters with high Dexterity and Charisma scores have a lot to gain from becoming tricksters. The path of the trickster is suitable for those who rely on subterfuge and cunning.</p></text>
        <Archmage>
          <name type="string">Archmage</name>
          <text type="formattedtext"><h>Archmage</h>
<p>For most practitioners of the arcane arts, learning magic requires a great deal of study and practice. Even for those who draw magic from their blood, the effort can be taxing. Not so for the archmage. This master of the arcane draws power from the very fabric of reality itself, learning to weave magic easily and naturally.</p>
<p>The archmage is the master of arcane magic, and many of the abilities of this path enhance your ability to cast arcane spells or greatly increase their potency. In addition, may of the options in this path increase your knowledge of magic and of those who wield it. At the highest tiers, you can begin to break down the walls between the different types of magic and alter the very fabric of reality itself.</p>
<p><b>Role</b>: As an archmage, you use your abilities to add a great deal of power to your arcane spells, enabling them to blast through defenses and cripple foes. Your mastery over the arcane arts and your vast knowledge are of great benefit to the rest of your group, and your talent at getting the most out of magic items can prove invaluable. Although you gain little in the way of defenses, your overwhelming offensive capabilities more than make up for it&#151;though you should still avoid being engaged in melee.</p>
<p><b>Classes</b>: The archmage is the most common path selection for characters capable of casting arcane spells, particularly sorcerers and wizards. Bards, summoners, and witches will find that this path has a great deal to offer, though some other paths might also prove useful to them.</p>
<p><b>Bonus Hit Points</b>: Whenever you gain an archmage tier, you gain 3 bonus hit points. These hit points stack with themselves, and don't affect your overall Hit Dice or other statistics.</p>

          <name type="string">Champion</name>
          <text type="formattedtext"><h>Champion</h>
<p>The champion is the pinnacle of skill at arms and armor. No ordinary fighter could hope to match the skill with a blade, a bow, or an axe that surges within a mythic champion. The champion turns aside blows and shatters shields with every movement, all while racing gracefully across the chaotic battlefield. When the screams of fallen foes die down, the champion stands strong and defiant in blood-spattered armor, hefting a weapon and shouting a terrifying war cry.</p>
<p><b>Role</b>: As a champion, your role is to take the fight to your enemies. Using devastating melee powers, you can crush your enemies before they even have a chance to harm you and your allies. Few can match your skill at arms or your ability to perform amazing feats of strength. The champion abilities allow you to control your foes, move easily around the battlefield, and challenge a large number of foes all at once. The rest of the party can count on you to dominate any melee you charge into.</p>
<p><b>Classes</b>: While members or nearly any class could be champions, those who focus on melee attacks&#151; barbarians, cavaliers, fighters, monks, paladins, and rangers&#151;will find the abilities in this path most attractive and useful. However, even magi or rogues could find that the path of the champion is an excellent way to augment their abilities.</p>
<p><b>Bonus Hit Points</b>: Whenever you gain a champion tier, you gain 5 bonus hit points. These hit points stack with themselves, and don't affect your overall Hit Dice or other statistics.</p>

          <text type="formattedtext"><h>Guardian</h>
<p>Not all mythic characters seek glory and fame for themselves. Some take a more humble route, watching over those dear to them or the lands they call home. Guardians seek connections with those around them, even the beasts, and draw their power from the trust of such bonds. This doesn't mean that all guardians are peaceful&#151;indeed many use violent means to further their goals and safeguard those they watch over. But they find worth in those who travel with them. In battle, none can take the sort of punishment and wounds that a guardian can sustain.</p>
<p><b>Role</b>: When others would retreat, you stand your ground. Your place is at the front of the battle, taking every hit your enemies can give while daring them to dish out more. Your job is to stop your enemies' advance, interposing yourself in the path of peril. You'll gladly take all that brutal punishment and return the beating with zeal. The wounds you suffer might kill a lesser hero, but you relish the thrill of combat, confident that your physical and mental perfection will lead to victory.</p>
<p><b>Classes</b>: Any class that is frequently in the middle of a chaotic melee will find many valuable abilities within the guardian path. Barbarians, cavaliers, fighters, inquisitors, monks, and paladins all make excellent guardians. Some of the guardian's powers also lend themselves to the druid, ranger, or even the summoner, granting bonuses to companions and allies.</p>
<p><b>Bonus Hit Points</b>: Whenever you gain a guardian tier, you gain 5 bonus hit points. These hit points stack with themselves, and don't affect your overall Hit Dice or other statistics.</p>

          <text type="formattedtext"><h>Hierophant</h>
<p>Those who draw upon a god's power find themselves becoming closer to the divine. Some aspire to become immortal servants of their gods, and others reach for apotheosis itself. A hierophant could be either of these, channeling divine power directly or indirectly&#151;whether from a deity, the spirit of nature, or the power of life itself&#151;and eventually becoming more like a patron of divine power than a mere devotee.</p>
<p><b>Role</b>: As a hierophant, your role in the group is to act as a conduit to the divine, healing and helping your allies through the miracles that you bestow. This focus is just as strong if you are instead a servant of nature, using the powers granted to you by this path to protect the wilderness and bring its fury to those who would dare to defile it.</p>
<p><b>Classes</b>: Members of any class that draws upon divine magic will find the path of the hierophant useful&#151;particularly clerics, druids, and oracles. Even classes with limited divine spellcasting, such as the inquisitor and paladin, have a number of useful options in this path.</p>
<p><b>Bonus Hit Points</b>: Whenever you gain a hierophant tier, you gain 4 bonus hit points. These hit points stack with themselves, and don't affect your overall Hit Dice or other statistics.</p>

<p>Seen only when they choose to be seen, tricksters manipulate kings and peasants alike, usually without anyone sensing their influence. Characters who rely upon their skills and wit find themselves drawn to the trickster's path. The mythic power of these heroes allows them to perform tasks that most would consider impossible. They can climb any wall, swim any current, and move without being seen by even the most observant guard. When they strike at their foes, they do so with unmatched accuracy.</p>
<p><b>Role</b>: As a trickster, your role in the party is one of deception and manipulation. You have access to a number of abilities that empower you to confound your foes, both physically and mentally. With a subtle jest or twist of phrase, you can steer entire cities and even nations to do your bidding&#151;but should that fail, you can always rely on a dagger from the shadows.</p>
<p><b>Classes</b>: Members of any class that relies on skills would make good tricksters, as would those who heavily utilize ranged combat or magical methods of subterfuge. The alchemist, bard, and rogue all have a number of abilities that fit well with the trickster. Gunslingers, monks, and rangers will also find that the trickster has more than a few interesting options.</p>
<p><b>Bonus Hit Points</b>: Whenever you gain a trickster tier, you gain 4 bonus hit points. These hit points stack with themselves, and don't affect your overall Hit Dice or other statistics.</p>

<h>Trickster Builds</h>
<p>When selecting your trickster's path abilities, you may wish to consider the following themes.

<p>Every mythic PC gains a number of base abilities common to all mythic characters, in addition to the special abilities granted by each mythic path. These abilities are gained based on the character's mythic tier.</p>
<p><b>Ability Score</b>: Upon reaching the 2nd mythic tier, an ability score of your choice permanently increases by 2. At 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th tiers, another ability score of your choice permanently increases by 2; this can be an ability score you've already increased or a different ability score.</p>
<p><b>Mythic Feat</b>: Select one mythic feat or non-mythic feat as a bonus feat. You must qualify for this feat normally. You gain another mythic feat at 3rd tier, and again every 2 tiers thereafter.</p>

        <text type="formattedtext"><h>Gaining Tiers</h>
<p>A character's mythic power is classified by tier, with a 1st-tier mythic character already being significantly more powerful than a non-mythic character of the same level and a 10th-tier mythic character possessing nearly godlike puissance. Mythic tiers are similar to levels in a class or prestige class in that the powers gained at each tier are added to all those that came before, but tiers are gained in a different manner from levels. A character gains a new mythic tier by completing a number of trials that occur during play. A trial is a difficult task that adds to the legend and story of your character. Achieving a new mythic tier occurs independently of experience point progression (though you will also gain experience points for the various encounters you complete as you progress through your trials).</p>
<p>Trials are moments in the story when you must rise above the deeds of lesser heroes. These moments become critical junctures in your legend. The GM decides what qualifies as a trial, and it's up to you to complete it as you would other adventures. You might not even know you are attempting a trial until it is completed and the GM informs you to note it on your mythic character sheet, though you'll likely get an inkling when you find yourself facing a particularly challenging foe or attempting something that most would find impossible.</p>
<p>The number of trials required to attain each new tier appears on the Mythic Trials per Tier table. For example, suppose a 5th-level fighter discovers her mythic heritage and becomes a 1st-tier champion. Over a number of sessions, she earns enough experience points to gain her 6th level of fighter. During this time, she doesn't complete a trial, so she doesn't advance to the next tier of the champion path. During the next session, however, she engages in a climactic battle against a mythic troll that has plagued the town for years; by defeating the troll, she completes her trial, allowing her to become a 2nd-tier champion. To reach 3rd tier, she will need to accomplish two more trials. A mythic character can't gain more than 10 tiers.</p>
<p>Note that the number of trials needed to achieve the next tier might vary from the number listed on the table below. The GM can reduce or increase this number as needed to suit the campaign&#151;refer to the Mythic Trials section for more guidance.</p>

      <text type="formattedtext"><h>Mythic Feats</h>
<p>Mythic characters and monsters gain mythic feats as they gain tiers or ranks. These feats can be selected only as part of mythic advancement, not as part of a character's normal advancement or in place of any other bonus feat.</p>
<p>Most mythic feats require a non-mythic feat as a prerequisite. These mythic feats enhance the benefits of their prerequisite feats, making them truly awe-inspiring. If a character doesn't possess any of the necessary prerequisite feats when she gains a mythic feat, she can wait to select a mythic feat until the next time she gains a tier or level.</p>
<p>A value in a mythic feat based on a fraction of your tier (such as a +1 bonus for every 3 tiers you possess) always has a minimum of 1.</p>
<p>This section includes some non-mythic feats. These grant a character who hasn't had a moment of ascension a measure of mythic might, and remain relevant if that character later becomes mythic.</p>

        <text type="formattedtext"><h>Types of Feats</h>
<p>Many feats belong to a category that has special rules associated to it. This category is listed after the feat name. The following types of feats can be found in this section.</p>
<h>Metamagic Feats</h>
<p>Metamagic feats allow spellcasters to modify and change their spells, granting the spells new powers and effects. Such spells generally take up a higher-level spell slot than the normal spell.</p>
<h>Mythic Feats</h>
<p>Only characters with mythic tiers or creatures with mythic ranks can take these feats. If a creature becomes non-mythic, it no longer gains the benefit of these feats, but it doesn't lose them permanently. If the creature becomes mythic again, it regains the use of all the mythic feats it once had.</p>
<p>Many mythic feats enhance non-mythic feats with the same name. When a creature has a mythic version of a feat, that feat is denoted with a superscript "M" in the feat line of its stat block.</p></text>

        <name type="string">Feat Description</name>
        <text type="formattedtext"><h>Feat Descriptions</h>
<p>Mythic feats are summarized in the table below. Note that the prerequisites and benefits of the feats on this table are abbreviated for ease of reference. See the feat descriptions for full details.</p>
<p>The following format is used for all feat descriptions.</p>
<p><b>Feat Name</b>: The feat's name also indicates what category, if any, the feat belongs to, and is followed by a basic description of what the feat does.</p>
<p><b>Prerequisite</b>: A minimum ability score, another feat or feats, a minimum base attack bonus, a minimum number of ranks in one or more skills, or anything else required in order to take the feat. This entry is absent if a feat has no prerequisite. A feat may have more than one prerequisite. Being a mythic character or monster is always a prerequisite for a mythic feat.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: What the feat enables the character ("you" in the feat description) to do. If a character has the same feat more than once, its benefits do not stack unless indicated otherwise in the description.</p>
<p><b>Normal</b>: What a character who does not have this feat is limited to or restricted from doing. If not having the feat causes no particular drawback, this entry is absent.</p>
<p><b>Special</b>: Additional unusual facts about the feat.</p>
