<h2 id="major-artifacts">Major Artifacts</h2>
<p>The greatest of all artifacts are unique items, coveted by the most powerful beings in existence and capable of altering the course of entire worlds. Only one of each major artifact exists, and even the least of them will certainly alter the balance of any campaign. Major artifacts are not easily destroyed&mdash;each has only a single, specific means of destruction, noted in its description. </p>
