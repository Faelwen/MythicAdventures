Each such animated object then immediately attacks whomever or whatever you initially designate.</p><p>An animated object can be of any nonmagical material.

The space within this barrier is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines.</p><p>An <i>antimagic field </i>suppresses any spell or magical effect used within, brought into, or cast into the area, but does not dispel it. Time spent within an <i>antimagic field </i>counts against the suppressed spell's duration.</p><p>Summoned creatures of any type wink out if they enter an <i>antimagic field. </i>They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the conjuration that is maintaining the creature. If you cast <i>antimagic field </i>in an area occupied by a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the creature's spell resistance to make it wink out. (The effects of instantaneous conjurations are not affected by an <i>antimagic field </i>because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result.)</p><p>A normal creature can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals, undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures' spell-like or supernatural abilities may be temporarily nullified by the field. <i>Dispel magic </i>does not remove the field.</p><p>Two or more <i>antimagic fields </i>sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as <i>wall of force, prismatic sphere</i>, and <i>prismatic wall, </i>remain unaffected by <i>antimagic field</i>. Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. </p><p>Should a creature be larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, any part of it that lies outside the barrier is unaffected by the field.</p>
Arboreal Hammer	Arboreal Hammer	transmutation	druid 4	1 standard action	V, S, DF	medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	one Huge or larger tree	1 round/level (D)	none	no	<h>Normal Use</h><p>This spell animates a tree's branch and directs it against your foes. At caster level 10th or lower, you can target a Huge tree. At caster level 11th-15th, you can target a Gargantuan tree, and at caster level 16th or higher you can target a Colossal tree. The animated branch makes slam attacks with a Strength score equal to 10 + your caster level. The branch strikes once per round with an attack bonus equal to your caster level + the branch's Strength modifier, adjusted by the appropriate size modifier (-2 for Huge, -4 for Gargantuan, -8 for Colossal). A Huge tree's slam deals 2d6 points of damage, a Gargantuan tree's slam deals 3d6 points of damage, and a Colossal tree's slam deals 4d6 points of damage; the tree adds 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier to this damage. A Huge tree has reach 15 feet, a Gargantuan has reach 20 feet, and a Colossal has reach 30 feet. The tree attacks the creature you designate when you cast the spell, and is unable to move. You can direct the tree against a new target as a move action. The tree does not gain a bonus for flanking, nor can it help another combatant flank. It cannot attack a foe you cannot see.</p>

If no unoccupied square is within range, the spell fails. The cannon comes into existence loaded. Each round thereafter, the cannon can either fire or load. A cannon must be loaded to fire. You do not need to supply ammunition for the cannon. </p><p>On your turn, you can spend a move action to direct the cannon to wheel itself to a new location, moving the cannon up to 20 feet. If the <i>arcane cannon</i> ever leaves your line of sight, it winks out of existence, and the spell's duration ends. </p><p>The cannon has a range increment of 50 feet. It targets touch attack in the first range increment, and it has no misfire chance. The cannon acts as a weapon with the <i>conductive</i> special weapon ability, which you can use to channel your spell-like or supernatural abilities as long as you are within the range of <i>arcane cannon</i>. The cannon's attack bonus is equal to your caster level + your Intelligence bonus or your Charisma bonus (for wizards or sorcerers, respectively) with an additional +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5 at 20th level). On a hit, the cannon deals 4d10 damage. The <i>arcane cannon</i> attacks have a critical modifier of x4.</p><p>The cannon has AC 10, hardness 10, and 80 hit points. If the cannon is subject to a spell or effect that requires a save, it uses your saving throw modifiers. The cannon never provokes attacks of opportunity. If the cannon is destroyed, so is your focus.</p>

When determining the tentacles' CMB, the tentacles use your caster level as their base attack bonus and receive a +4 bonus due to their Strength and a +1 size bonus. Roll only once for the entire spell effect each round and apply the result to all creatures in the area of effect.</p><p>If the tentacles succeed in grappling a foe, that foe takes 1d6+4 points of damage and gains the grappled condition. Grappled opponents cannot move without first breaking the grapple. All other movement is prohibited unless the creature breaks the grapple first. The <i>black tentacles</i> spell receives a +5 bonus on grapple checks made against opponents it is already grappling, but cannot move foes or pin foes. Each round that <i>black tentacles</i> succeeds on a grapple check, it deals an additional 1d6+4 points of damage. The CMD of <i>black tentacles</i>, for the purposes of escaping the grapple, is equal to 10 + its CMB.</p><p>The tentacles created by this spell cannot be damaged, but they can be dispelled as normal.

If the attack is capable of striking ethereal creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for concealment).</p><p>If the attacker can see invisible creatures, the miss chance is also only 20%. (For an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures, there is no miss chance.) Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike.</p><p>Any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you're blinking unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. Your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane (but they might affect targets on the Ethereal Plane).</p><p>While blinking, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane). Although you are only partially visible, you are not considered invisible and targets retain their Dexterity bonus to AC against your attacks. You do receive a +2 bonus on attack rolls made against enemies that cannot see invisible creatures.</p><p>You take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.</p><p>While blinking, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled.</p><p>Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures. You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones.</p><p>An ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down. As an incorporeal creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures.</p><p>An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.</p><p>Force effects and abjurations affect you normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane.

When you cast this spell, make an Intimidate check to demoralize each enemy within 30 feet of you. Enemies that are demoralized this way take 1d10 points of fire damage and must succeed at a Reflex save or catch fire.

Blood Crow Strike	Blood Crow Strike	evocation [fire]	cleric 4	1 round	V, S	medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	one creature	instantaneous	none	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>Your unarmed strikes release blasts of energy in the form of bolts of fire or glowing red crows, which fly instantaneously to strike your target. You can make unarmed strike or flurry of blows attacks against the target as if it were in your threatened area; each successful attack deals damage as if you had hit it with your unarmed strike, except half the damage is fire and half is negative energy (this negative energy does not heal undead). For example, if you are a 14th-level monk, you can use a flurry of blows to attack five times, creating one energy crow for each successful attack against the target, and dealing 2d6 points of damage (plus appropriate unarmed strike modifiers) with each crow.</p><h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Unarmed strikes attempted with this spell are treated as if you had the Improved Critical (unarmed strike) feat.

For each such effect, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect. Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect. For a cursed magic item, the DC is equal to the DC of the curse.</p><p>If the spell is one that cannot be dispelled by <i>dispel magic</i> or <i>stone to flesh</i>, <i>break enchantment </i>works only if that spell is 5th level or lower. </p><p>If the effect comes from a permanent magic item, <i>break enchantment </i>does not remove the curse from the item, but it does free the victim from the item's effects. </p>

If the healed creature's hit point total is at a negative amount less than its Constitution score, it comes back to life and stabilizes at its new hit point total. If the creature's hit point total is at a negative amount equal to or greater than its Constitution score, the creature remains dead.

Targeted creatures must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of fire damage. Unattended objects do not get a save. Creatures damaged by the spell must make a Reflex save or catch fire. Each round, burning creatures may attempt a Reflex save to quench the flames; failure results in another 1d6 points of fire damage. Flammable items worn by a creature must also save or take the same damage as the creature. If a creature or object is already on fire, it suffers no additional effects from <i>burning gaze</i>.</p><p>Note that this spell does not grant an actual gaze attack--;foes and allies are not in danger of catching on fire simply by meeting your gaze. </p>
Burning Hands	Burning Hands	evocation [fire]	sorcerer/wizard 1	1 standard action	V, S	15 ft.	cone-shaped burst	instantaneous	Reflex half	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>A cone of searing flame shoots from your fingertips.

Using <i>burrow</i> requires only as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells normally. The burrowing creature cannot charge or run. Loose material collapses behind the target 1 round after it leaves the area. This spell does not give the target the ability to breathe underground, so when passing through loose material, the creature must hold its breath and take only short trips, or else it may suffocate.</p>
Call Animal	Call Animal	enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]	druid 1, ranger 1	1 standard action	V, S, DF	see description	one animal whose CR is equal or less than your caster level	1 hour/level (D)	none	none	<h>Normal Use</h><p>This spell calls the nearest wild animal of a particular type you designate (provided the animal's CR is equal to or less than your caster level) to seek you out. The animal moves toward you under its own power, so the time it takes to arrive depends on how close an animal of the desired type is when you cast the spell. If there is no animal of that type capable of reaching you within the spell's duration, you are aware of this fact, but the spell is wasted. Knowledge of the local fauna makes this spell more effective, and the GM may permit a Knowledge (nature) skill check (DC 15) to know what animals can be found in an area.</p><p>When the called animal arrives, it approaches to within 5 feet of you and remains nearby for the duration of the spell. Its starting attitude is indifferent, modified by circumstances and interaction. Other than starting attitude, this spell gives you no special influence or ability to communicate with the called animal, although you may use other spells or abilities to do so.</p><p>Once the spell's duration expires, the animal acts in accordance with its attitude. Most animals will likely wander off, but a hostile predatory animal may attack, especially if it is hungry or provoked.</p><p>Domesticated animals or animals trained by someone else, including such creatures as familiars or animal companions, are unaffected by <i>call animals</i>.</p><h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>You can call up to one animal per 2 caster levels. Animals that answer your call have a starting attitude of friendly. Add your tier to Handle Animal checks attempted to influence these animals.</p><p>You may use this spell to call magical beasts with Intelligence 1 or 2, but they can attempt Will saving throws (with a +4 bonus) to resist the spell.</p>
Call Lightning	Call Lightning	evocation [electricity]	druid 3	1 round	V, S	medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	one or more 30-ft.-long vertical lines of lightning	1 min./level	Reflex half	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>Immediately upon completion of the spell, and once per round thereafter, you may call down a 5-foot-wide, 30-foot-long, vertical bolt of lightning that deals 3d6 points of electricity damage. The bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at whatever target point you choose within the spell's range (measured from your position at the time). Any creature in the target square or in the path of the bolt is affected.</p><p>You need not call a bolt of lightning immediately; other actions, even spellcasting, can be performed first. Each round after the first you may use a standard action (concentrating on the spell) to call a bolt. You may call a total number of bolts equal to your caster level (maximum 10 bolts).</p><p>If you are outdoors and in a stormy area--;a rain shower, clouds and wind, hot and cloudy conditions, or even a tornado (including a whirlwind formed by a djinni or an air elemental of at least Large size)--;each bolt deals 3d10 points of electricity damage instead of 3d6.</p><p>This spell functions indoors or underground but not underwater.</p>
Cape of Wasps	Cape of Wasps	conjuration (summoning)	druid 4, witch 4	1 standard action	V, S	personal	you	1 round/level (D)	none	none	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You summon a wasp swarm, which fills your space (up to 5 feet by 5 feet) but does not attack you. The dense cloud of vermin gives you partial concealment against ranged attacks. Any creature that makes a successful melee attack against you takes 2d6 points of swarm damage and poison from the wasp swarm, but is not affected by the swarm's distraction ability. As a free action on your turn, you may have the swarm cling to you tightly, giving you a fly speed of 20 feet (poor maneuverability); when using the swarm to fly, it does not provide concealment or harm creatures that strike you. You can return the swarm to its protective shape as a free action on your turn.</p><h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The wasp swarm fills a 15-foot-by-15-foot space centered on you (or on 1 of your squares, if your space is larger than 1 square). Creatures in the area of the swarm are affected by it normally (including the swarm's distraction ability). Add your tier to the swarm's distraction DC.</p><p>When you use the swarm to fly, it fills only your space, your fly speed is 30 feet (average maneuverability), and the swarm still provides partial concealment against ranged attacks.</p>
Chain Lightning	Chain Lightning	evocation [electricity]	sorcerer/wizard 6	1 standard action	V, S, F (a bit of fur; a piece of amber, glass, or a crystal rod; plus one silver pin per caster level)	long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)	one primary target, plus one secondary target/level (each of which must be within 30 ft. of the primary target)	instantaneous	Reflex half	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>This spell creates an electrical discharge that begins as a single stroke commencing from your fingertips. Unlike <i>lightning bolt</i>, <i>chain lightning </i>strikes one object or creature initially, then arcs to other targets.</p><p>The bolt deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to the primary target. After it strikes, lightning can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your caster level (maximum 20). The secondary bolts each strike one target and deal as much damage as the primary bolt.</p><p>Each target can attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage. The Reflex DC to halve the damage of the secondary bolts is 2 lower than the DC to halve the damage of the primary bolt. You choose secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum.</p>
Changestaff	Changestaff	transmutation	druid 7	1 round	V, S, F (a quarterstaff that has been carved and polished for 28 days)	touch	your touched staff	1 hour/level (D)	none	no	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You change a specially prepared quarterstaff into a Huge treant-like creature, about 24 feet tall. When you plant the end of the staff in the ground and speak a special command to conclude the casting of the spell, your staff turns into a creature that looks and fights just like a treant. The staff-treant defends you and obeys any spoken commands. However, it is by no means a true treant; it cannot converse with actual treants or control trees. If the staff-treant is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it crumbles to powder and the staff is destroyed. Otherwise, the staff returns to its normal form when the spell duration expires (or when the spell is dismissed), and it can be used as the focus for another casting of the spell. The staff-treant is always at full strength when created, despite any wounds it may have incurred the last time it appeared.</p>
Chaos Hammer	Chaos Hammer	evocation [chaotic]	cleric 4	1 standard action	V, S	medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	20-ft.-radius burst	instantaneous (1d6 rounds); see text	Will partial; see text	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You unleash chaotic power to smite your enemies. The power takes the form of a multicolored explosion of leaping, ricocheting energy. Only lawful and neutral (not chaotic) creatures are harmed by the spell.</p><p>The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to lawful creatures (or 1d6 points of damage per caster level, maximum 10d6, to lawful outsiders) and slows them for 1d6 rounds (see the <i>slow</i> spell). A successful Will save reduces the damage by half and negates the slow effect.</p><p>The spell deals only half damage against creatures who are neither lawful nor chaotic, and they are not slowed. Such a creature can reduce the damage by half again (down to one-quarter) with a successful Will save.</p>

Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no saving throw. Magical metal is allowed a saving throw against the spell. An item in a creature's possession uses the creature's saving throw bonus unless its own is higher.</p><p>A creature takes cold damage if its equipment is chilled. It takes full damage if its armor, shield, or weapon is affected. The creature takes minimum damage (1 point or 2 points; see the table) if it's not wearing or wielding such an item.</p><p>On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes chilly and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage. The same effect also occurs on the last round of the spell's duration. During the second (and also the next-to-last) round, icy coldness causes pain and damage. In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is freezing cold, and causes more damage, as shown on the table below.</p><p>Any heat intense enough to damage the creature negates cold damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis. Underwater, <i>chill metal </i>deals no damage, but ice immediately forms around the affected metal, making it float if unattended.</p><p><i>Chill metal </i>counters and dispels <i>heat metal</i>.</p>
Chord of Shards	Chord of Shards	evocation	bard 1	1 standard action	V, S	15 ft.	cone-shaped burst	instantaneous	Reflex negates	no	<h>Normal Use</h><p>During your bardic performance, you can strike a chord whose notes transform into a shower of razor sharp, crystalline shards.

Circle of Death	Circle of Death	necromancy [death]	sorcerer/wizard 6	1 standard action	V, S, M (a crushed black pearl worth 500 gp)	medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	several living creatures within a 40-ft.-radius burst	instantaneous	Fortitude negates	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p><i>Circle of death </i>snuffs out the life force of living creatures, killing them instantly. The spell slays 1d4 HD worth of living creatures per caster level (maximum 20d4). Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first; among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the burst's point of origin are affected first. No creature of 9 or more HD can be affected, and HD that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted.</p>
Cloudkill	Cloudkill	conjuration (creation)	sorcerer/wizard 5	1 standard action	V, S	medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	cloud spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high	1 min./level	Fortitude partial; see text	no	<h>Normal Use</h><p>This spell generates a bank of fog, similar to a <i>fog cloud, </i>except that its vapors are yellowish green and poisonous. These vapors automatically kill any living creature with 3 or fewer HD (no save). A living creature with 4 to 6 HD is slain unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save (in which case it takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage on your turn each round while in the cloud).</p><p>A living creature with 6 or more HD takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage on your turn each round while in the cloud (a successful Fortitude save halves this damage).

You must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit. Any creature struck by the ray takes 2d6 points of damage per caster level (to a maximum of 40d6). Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this spell is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated creature's equipment is unaffected.</p><p>When used against an object, the ray simply disintegrates as much as a 10-foot cube of nonliving matter. Thus, the spell disintegrates only part of any very large object or structure targeted. The ray affects even objects constructed entirely of force, such as <i>forceful hand </i>or a <i>wall of force</i>, but not magical effects such as a <i>globe of invulnerability </i>or an <i>antimagic field.</i></p><p>A creature or object that makes a successful Fortitude save is partially affected, taking only 5d6 points of damage. If this damage reduces the creature or object to 0 or fewer hit points, it is entirely disintegrated.</p><p>Only the first creature or object struck can be affected; that is, the ray affects only one target per casting.</p>
Dispel Magic	Dispel Magic	abjuration	bard 3, cleric 3, druid 4, paladin 3, sorcerer/wizard 3	1 standard action	V, S	medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	one spellcaster, creature, or object	instantaneous	none	no	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You can use <i>dispel magic </i>to end one ongoing spell that has been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by <i>dispel magic</i>. <i>Dispel magic </i>can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the <i>dispel magic </i>can take effect. </p><p>You choose to use <i>dispel magic </i>in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell.</p><p><i>Targeted Dispel</i>: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the <i>dispel magic </i>spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell's caster level). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell.</p><p> For example, a 7th-level caster casts <i>dispel magic</i>, targeting a creature affected by <i>stoneskin </i>(caster level 12th) and <i>fly</i> (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the <i>stoneskin</i> (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the <i>fly</i> (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the <i>stoneskin</i> would have been dispelled, leaving the <i>fly </i>intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected.</p><p>You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a <i>wall of fire</i>). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect.</p><p>If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by <i>summon monster</i>), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.</p><p>If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level (DC = 11 + the item's caster level). If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a <i>bag of holding</i>) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.</p><p>You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.</p><p><i>Counterspell</i>: When <i>dispel magic </i>is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, <i>dispel magic </i>may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.</p>

If that creature has a burrow, climb, fly, or swim speed, you gain that form of movement for the duration of the spell at the same speed and maneuverability as the selected creature. If this gives you the burrow or swim speed, you can breathe while burrowing or swimming. If the creature moves 1,000 feet or more from you, the spell ends. If the creature has more than one of these types of movement, you select one from the types available to the creature.</p><h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The speed of the movement form provided by the spell increases by 30 feet. This adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus. You gain a bonus on Perception and Survival skill checks attempted against the selected creature.

If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as ""Come here,"" ""Go there,"" ""Fight,"" and ""Stand still."" You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically.</p><p>Once you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth). Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can determine that the subject's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill description).</p><p>Changing your orders or giving a dominated creature a new command is a move action.</p><p>By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can't communicate with you. You can't actually see through the subject's eyes, so it's not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what's going on.</p><p>Subjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the subject to control it.</p><p>If you don't spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each day, the subject receives a new saving throw to throw off the domination.</p><p><i>Protection from evil </i>or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but such an effect does not automatically dispel it.</p>"

Releasing energy in this way does not ""free up"" space to absorb still more energy; the maximum amount of energy the spell can absorb remains fixed. The subject cannot release more energy than he currently has absorbed. Once the subject has absorbed all the energy allowed by the spell, he takes damage as normal from that energy type. Once the energy has been released, the spell is discharged.</p><p><i>Draconic reservoir</i> does not stack with <i>protection from energy</i>. <i>Draconic reservoir</i> overlaps (and does not stack with) <i>resist energy</i>.

At the beginning of the spell, you must name the recipient or identify him or her by some title that leaves no doubt as to identity. The messenger then enters a trance, appears in the intended recipient's dream, and delivers the message. The message can be of any length, and the recipient remembers it perfectly upon waking. The communication is one-way. The recipient cannot ask questions or offer information, nor can the messenger gain any information by observing the dreams of the recipient.</p><p>Once the message is delivered, the messenger's mind returns instantly to its body. The duration of the spell is the time required for the messenger to enter the recipient's dream and deliver the message.</p><p>If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, the messenger can choose to wake up (ending the spell) or remain in the trance. The messenger can remain in the trance until the recipient goes to sleep, then enter the recipient's dream and deliver the message as normal. A messenger that is disturbed during the trance comes awake, ending the spell.</p><p>Creatures who don't sleep or don't dream cannot be contacted by this spell.</p><p>The messenger is unaware of its own surroundings or of the activities around it while in the trance. It is defenseless both physically and mentally (always failing any saving throw) while in the trance.</p>

The powerful shockwave created by this spell knocks creatures down, collapses structures, opens cracks in the ground, and more. The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures on the ground can't move or attack. A spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast. The earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area. The specific effect of an <i>earthquake </i>spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast.</p><p><i>Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel</i>: The roof collapses, dealing 8d6 points of damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC 15 half) and pinning that creature beneath the rubble (see below). An <i>earthquake </i>cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris and rubble.</p><p><i>Cliffs</i>:<i> Earthquake </i>causes a cliff to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it falls vertically. Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).</p><p><i>Open Ground</i>: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure). The fissures are 40 feet deep. At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut. Treat all trapped creatures as if they were in the bury zone of an avalanche, trapped without air (see Environment for more details).</p><p><i>Structure</i>: Any structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).</p><p><i>River, Lake, or Marsh</i>: Fissures open under the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand. At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.</p><p><i>Pinned Beneath Rubble</i>: Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a pinned character falls unconscious, he or she must make a DC 15 Constitution check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead.</p>

The target gains a +2 size bonus to Strength, a -2 size penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum of 1), and a -1 penalty on attack rolls and AC due to its increased size.</p><p>A humanoid creature whose size increases to Large has a space of 10 feet and a natural reach of 10 feet. This spell does not change the target's speed.</p><p>If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it--;the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size.</p><p>All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly enlarged by the spell. Melee weapons affected by this spell deal more damage (see Table: Tiny and Large Weapon Damage). Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any <i>enlarged </i>item that leaves an enlarged creature's possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown and projectile weapons deal their normal damage. Magical properties of enlarged items are not increased by this spell.</p><p>Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack.</p><p><i>Enlarge person </i>counters and dispels <i>reduce person</i>.</p><p><i>Enlarge person </i>can be made permanent with a <i>permanency </i>spell.</p>
Entangle	Entangle	transmutation	druid 1, ranger 1	1 standard action	V, S, DF	long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)	plants in a 40-ft.-radius spread	1 min./level (D)	Reflex partial; see text	no	<h>Normal Use</h><p>This spell causes tall grass, weeds, and other plants to wrap around creatures in the area of effect or those that enter the area. Creatures that fail their save gain the entangled condition. Creatures that make their save can move as normal, but those that remain in the area must save again at the end of your turn. Creatures that move into the area must save immediately. Those that fail must end their movement and gain the entangled condition. Entangled creatures can attempt to break free as a move action, making a Strength or Escape Artist check. The DC for this check is equal to the DC of the spell. The entire area of effect is considered difficult terrain while the effect lasts.</p><p>If the plants in the area are covered in thorns, those in the area take 1 point of damage each time they fail a save against the <i>entangle</i> or fail a check made to break free. Other effects, depending on the local plants, might be possible at GM discretion.</p>
Entropic Shield	Entropic Shield	abjuration	cleric 1	1 standard action	V, S	personal	you	1 min./level (D)	none	none	<h>Normal Use</h><p>A magical field appears around you, glowing with a chaotic blast of multicolored hues. This field deflects incoming arrows, rays, and other ranged attacks. Each ranged attack directed at you for which the attacker must make an attack roll has a 20% miss chance (similar to the effects of concealment). Other attacks that simply work at a distance are not affected.</p><h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>When a ranged attack misses because of this spell, there is a 50% chance that the attack is redirected back at the attacker rather than just being deflected harmlessly. The attack uses the same result as the attack roll the attacker made against you.</p>
Expeditious Retreat	Expeditious Retreat	transmutation	bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1	1 standard action	V, S	personal	you	1 min./level (D)	none	none	<h>Normal Use</h><p>This spell increases your base land speed by 30 feet. This adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus. There is no effect on other modes of movement, such as burrow, climb, fly, or swim. As with any effect that increases your speed, this spell affects your jumping distance (see the Acrobatics skill).</p><h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The speed bonus from the spell increases to 40 feet. Add your tier to Acrobatics checks to avoid attacks of opportunity from movement, and when your movement provokes an attack of opportunity, add your tier to your AC against that attack.</p>
Faerie Fire	Faerie Fire	evocation [light]	druid 1	1 standard action	V, S, DF	long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)	creatures and objects within a 5-ft.-radius burst	1 min./level (D)	none	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>A pale glow surrounds and outlines the subjects. Outlined subjects shed light as candles. Creatures outlined by <i>faerie fire</i> take a -20 penalty on all Stealth checks. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness (though a 2nd-level or higher magical <i>darkness </i>effect functions normally), <i>blur</i>, <i>displacement, invisibility,</i> or similar effects. The light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light. The <i>faerie fire </i>can be blue, green, or violet, according to your choice at the time of casting. The <i>faerie fire </i>does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.</p>
False Life	False Life	necromancy	sorcerer/wizard 2	1 standard action	V, S, M (a drop of blood)	personal	you	1 hour/level or until discharged; see text	none	none	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You harness the power of unlife to grant yourself a limited ability to avoid death. While this spell is in effect, you gain temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + 1 per caster level (maximum +10).</p><h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The temporary hit points gained increase to 2d8 + 2 per caster level (maximum +20). As an immediate action, you can dismiss the remaining duration of the spell to prevent 1 point of Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution damage per 10 temporary hit points remaining from the spell. This takes effect after the attack hits you and the damage is rolled, but before you take the damage. For example, if you have 22 temporary hit points from <i>mythic false life</i> and a wyvern stings you for 3 points of Constitution damage, you can dismiss the spell to prevent 2 points of Constitution damage from that attack.</p>
Feast of Ashes	Feast of Ashes	transmutation	druid 2, witch 2	1 standard action	V, S, M (a pinch of ash)	close (25 ft. + 5 ft/2 levels)	one creature	2 days/level (D)	Fortitude negates	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You curse the target with a hunger no food can assuage. On a failed saving throw, the target begins to starve. The effects of this spell cannot inflict more nonlethal damage than the target has hit points. No amount of eating can counter the effect and, further, even attempting to eat causes the target to become nauseated for 1 round unless they make a DC 12 Fortitude save. The target still experiences the other normal effects of anything consumed (such as poisons or potions). <i>Feast of ashes</i> can be removed with a <i>break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, </i>or <i>wish</i> spell, but effects suffered as a result of starvation must be healed by normal means.</p><h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>On a failed save, the target immediately takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per tier. Add your tier to the DC of any further Constitution checks the target attempts to resist the effects of starvation as part of this spell's effects. While the curse is in effect, the target gains no benefit from any spell, effect, or item that requires eating, such as the food from a <i>heroes' feast</i> spell (though the food is still used up when the target eats it).</p>
Feather Fall	Feather Fall	transmutation	bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1	1 immediate action	V	close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	one Medium or smaller freefalling object or creature/level, no two of which may be more than 20 ft. apart	until landing or 1 round/level	Will negates (harmless) or Will negates (object)	yes (object)	<h>Normal Use</h><p>The affected creatures or objects fall slowly. <i>Feather fall </i>instantly changes the rate at which the targets fall to a mere 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet), and the subjects take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. When the spell duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes.</p><p>The spell affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures (including gear and carried objects up to each creature's maximum load) or objects, or the equivalent in larger creatures: a Large creature or object counts as two Medium creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as four Medium creatures or objects, and so forth.</p><p>This spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a distance. If the spell is cast on a falling item, the object does half normal damage based on its weight, with no bonus for the height of the drop.</p><p><i>Feather fall </i>works only upon free-falling objects. It does not affect a sword blow or a charging or flying creature.</p>
Finger of Death	Finger of Death	necromancy [death]	druid 8, sorcerer/wizard 7	1 standard action	V, S	close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	one creature	instantaneous	Fortitude partial	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>This spell instantly delivers 10 points of damage per caster level. If the target's Fortitude saving throw succeeds, it instead takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level. The subject might die from damage even if it succeeds on its saving throw.</p>
Fire Seeds	Fire Seeds	conjuration (creation) [fire]	druid 6	1 standard action	V, S, M (acorns or holly berries)	touch	up to four acorns or up to eight holly berries	10 min./level or until used	none or Reflex half; see text	no	<h>Normal Use</h><p>Depending on the version of <i>fire seeds </i>you choose, you turn acorns into splash weapons that you or another character can throw, or you turn holly berries into bombs that you can detonate on command.</p><p><i>Acorn Grenades</i>: As many as four acorns turn into special thrown splash weapons. An acorn grenade has a range increment of 20 feet. A ranged touch attack roll is required to strike the intended target. Together, the acorns are capable of dealing 1d4 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d4) divided among the acorns as you wish. No acorn can deal more than 10d4 points of damage.</p><p>Each acorn grenade explodes upon striking any hard surface. In addition to its regular fire damage, all creatures adjacent to the explosion take 1 point of fire damage per die of the explosion. This explosion of fire ignites any combustible materials adjacent to the target.</p><p><i>Holly Berry Bombs</i>: You turn as many as eight holly berries into special bombs. The holly berries are usually placed by hand, since they are too light to make effective thrown weapons (they can be tossed only 5 feet). If you are within 200 feet and speak a word of command, each berry instantly bursts into flame, causing 1d8 points of fire damage + 1 point per caster level to every creature in a 5-foot-radius burst and igniting any combustible materials within 5 feet. A creature in the area that makes a successful Reflex saving throw takes only half damage.</p>
Fire Shield	Fire Shield	evocation [fire or cold]	sorcerer/wizard 4	1 standard action	V, S, M (phosphorus for the warm shield; a firefly or glowworm for the chill shield)	personal	you	1 round/level (D)	none	none	<h>Normal Use</h><p>This spell wreathes you in flame and causes damage to each creature that attacks you in melee. The flames also protect you from either cold-based or fire-based attacks, depending on if you choose cool or warm flames for your <i>fire shield</i>.</p><p>Any creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). This damage is either cold damage (if you choose a <i>chill shield</i>) or fire damage (if you choose a <i>warm shield</i>). If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect. Creatures wielding melee weapons with reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you.</p><p>When casting this spell, you appear to immolate yourself, but the flames are thin and wispy, increasing the light level within 10 feet by one step, up to normal light. The color of the flames is blue or green if the <i>chill shield </i>is cast, violet or red if the <i>warm shield </i>is employed. The special powers of each version are as follows.</p><p><i>Chill Shield</i>: The flames are cool to the touch. You take only half damage from fire-based attacks. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful saving throw.</p><p><i>Warm Shield</i>: The flames are warm to the touch. You take only half damage from cold-based attacks. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful saving throw.</p><h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage dealt to your attackers increases to 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). A chill shield gives you fire immunity. A warm shield gives you cold immunity.</p>
Fire Snake	Fire Snake	evocation [fire]	druid 5, sorcerer/wizard 5	1 standard action	V, S, M (a snake scale)	60 ft.	see text	instantaneous	Reflex half	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You create a sinuous line of flames that you may shape as desired. The <i>fire snake</i> affects one 5-foot square per caster level, and each square must be adjacent to the previous square, starting with you. The <i>fire snake</i> may not extend beyond its maximum range. Creatures in the path of the <i>fire snake</i> take 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 15d6).</p>
Fire Storm	Fire Storm	evocation [fire]	cleric 8, druid 7	1 standard action	V, S	medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	two 10-ft. cubes per level (S)	instantaneous	Reflex half	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>When a <i>fire storm </i>spell is cast, the whole area is shot through with sheets of roaring flame. The raging flames do not harm natural vegetation, ground cover, or any plant creatures in the area that you wish to exclude from damage. Any other creature within the area takes 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d6). Creatures that fail their Reflex save catch on fire, taking 4d6 points of fire damage each round until the flames are extinguished. Extinguishing the flames is a full-round action that requires a DC 20 Reflex save.</p>
Fireball	Fireball	evocation [fire]	sorcerer/wizard 3	1 standard action	V, S, M (a ball of bat guano and sulfur)	long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)	20-ft.-radius spread	instantaneous	Reflex half	yes	"<h>Normal Use</h><p>A <i>fireball </i>spell generates a searing explosion of flame that detonates with a low roar and deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to every creature within the area. Unattended objects also take this damage. The explosion creates almost no pressure.</p><p>You point your finger and determine the range (distance and height) at which the <i>fireball </i>is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the <i>fireball </i>at that point. An early impact results in an early detonation. If you attempt to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow slit, you must ""hit"" the opening with a ranged touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.</p><p>The <i>fireball </i>sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the <i>fireball </i>may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.</p>"
Firestream	Firestream	evocation [fire]	magus 3, sorcerer/wizard 3	1 standard action 	V, S	20 ft.	20-ft. line	concentration, up to 1 round/level; see text	Reflex half	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>A rushing stream of fire sprays from your outstretched hand, dealing 2d6 points of fire damage to every creature in the area. Each round you continue to concentrate on the spell, you can select a new area for it to affect.</p><p><i>Firestream</i> sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the firestream may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.</p><h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage dealt increases to 2d10 points of fire damage. Any creature that fails its saving throw also catches fire. The continuous line of fire pushes against all creatures, making them treat the spell's area as difficult terrain.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (4th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you create a second line of fire using your other hand. If you overlap the lines, creatures in the overlap must attempt two saving throws and take the lower result, but don't take damage from both lines. You may stop either line of fire as a free action on your turn, but once you stop maintaining a line, you must cast <i>mythic firestream</i> again to recreate it.</p>
Flame Blade	Flame Blade	evocation [fire]	druid 2	1 standard action	V, S, DF	0 ft.	sword-like beam	1 min./level (D)	none	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>A 3-foot-long, blazing beam of red-hot fire springs forth from your hand. You wield this blade-like beam as if it were a scimitar. Attacks with the <i>flame blade </i>are melee touch attacks. The blade deals 1d8 points of fire damage + 1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10). Since the blade is immaterial, your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage. A <i>flame blade </i>can ignite combustible materials such as parchment, straw, dry sticks, and cloth.</p>
Flame Strike	Flame Strike	evocation [fire]	cleric 5, druid 4	1 standard action	V, S, DF	medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	cylinder (10-ft. radius, 40-ft. high)	instantaneous	Reflex half	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>A <i>flame strike </i>evokes a vertical column of divine fire. The spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). Half the damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks.</p>
Flames of the Faithful	Flames of the Faithful	transmutation [fire]	inquisitor 2	1 standard action	V	touch	weapon touched	1 round/level	Fortitude negates (object, harmless)	yes (object, harmless)	<h>Normal Use</h><p>With a touch, you cause a glowing rune to appear on a single weapon, granting that weapon the <i>flaming</i> property (and allowing it to cause an extra 1d6 points of fire damage on a successful hit). If you are using the judgment class feature, your weapon gains the <i>flaming burst</i> property instead. The spell functions only for weapons that you wield. If the weapon leaves your hand for any reason, the spell effect ends. The effects of this spell do not stack with any existing <i>flaming</i> or <i>flaming burst</i> weapon property that the target weapon may already possess. </p>
Flesh to Stone	Flesh to Stone	transmutation	sorcerer/wizard 6	1 standard action	V, S, M (lime, water, and earth)	medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	one creature	instantaneous	Fortitude negates	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>The subject, along with all its carried gear, turns into a mindless, inert statue. If the statue resulting from this spell is broken or damaged, the subject (if ever returned to its original state) has similar damage or deformities. The creature is not dead, but it does not seem to be alive either when viewed with spells such as <i>deathwatch</i>.</p><p>Only creatures made of flesh are affected by this spell.</p>
Floating Disk	Floating Disk	evocation [force]	sorcerer/wizard 1	1 standard action	V, S, M (a drop of mercury)	close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	3-ft.-diameter disk of force	1 hour/level	none	no	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You create a slightly concave, circular plane of force that follows you about and carries loads for you. The disk is 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch deep at its center. It can hold 100 pounds of weight per caster level. If used to transport a liquid, its capacity is 2 gallons. The disk floats approximately 3 feet above the ground at all times and remains level. It floats along horizontally within spell range and will accompany you at a rate of no more than your normal speed each round. If not otherwise directed, it maintains a constant interval of 5 feet between itself and you. The disk winks out of existence when the spell duration expires. The disk also winks out if you move beyond its range or try to take the disk more than 3 feet away from the surface beneath it. When the disk winks out, whatever it was supporting falls to the surface beneath it.</p>
Fly	Fly	transmutation	sorcerer/wizard 3	1 standard action	V, S, F (a wing feather)	touch	creature touched	1 min./level	Will negates (harmless)	yes (harmless)	<h>Normal Use</h><p>The subject can fly at a speed of 60 feet (or 40 feet if it wears medium or heavy armor, or if it carries a medium or heavy load). It can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed, and its maneuverability is good. Using a <i>fly </i>spell requires only as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells normally. The subject of a <i>fly </i>spell can charge but not run, and it cannot carry aloft more weight than its maximum load, plus any armor it wears. The subject gains a bonus on Fly skill checks equal to 1/2 your caster level.</p><p>Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends safely in this way if the <i>fly </i>spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an <i>antimagic field</i>.</p>
Fog Cloud	Fog Cloud	conjuration (creation)	druid 2, sorcerer/wizard 2	1 standard action	V, S	medium (100 ft. + 10 ft. level)	fog spreads in 20-ft. radius	10 min./level	none	no	<h>Normal Use</h><p>A bank of fog billows out from the point you designate. The fog obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target).</p><p>A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.</p><p>The spell does not function underwater.</p>
Force Punch	Force Punch	evocation [force]	magus 3, sorcerer/wizard 3	1 standard action	V, S	touch	creature touched	instantaneous	Fortitude partial	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>This spell charges your hand with telekinetic force. Your successful melee touch attack deals 1d4 points of force damage per level (maximum 10d4) and causes the target to be pushed away from you in a straight line up to 5 feet per two caster levels. For every size category of the target above Medium, reduce the distance pushed by 5 feet (-5 feet for Large, -10 feet for Huge, -15 for Gargantuan, and -20 feet for Colossal) to a minimum of 0 feet. A successful Fortitude save negates the movement but not the damage.</p>
Foresight	Foresight	divination	druid 9, sorcerer/wizard 9	1 standard action	V, S, M/DF (a hummingbird's feather)	personal or touch	see text	10 min./level	none or Will negates (harmless)	no or yes (harmless)	<h>Normal Use</h><p>This spell grants you a powerful sixth sense in relation to yourself or another. Once <i>foresight </i>is cast, you receive instantaneous warnings of impending danger or harm to the subject of the spell. You are never surprised or flat-footed. In addition, the spell gives you a general idea of what action you might take to best protect yourself and gives you a +2 insight bonus to AC and on Reflex saves. This insight bonus is lost whenever you would lose a Dexterity bonus to AC.</p><p>When another creature is the subject of the spell, you receive warnings about that creature. You must communicate what you learn to the other creature for the warning to be useful, and the creature can be caught unprepared in the absence of such a warning. Shouting a warning, yanking a person back, and even telepathically communicating (via an appropriate spell) can all be accomplished before some danger befalls the subject, provided you act on the warning without delay. The subject, however, does not gain the insight bonus to AC and Reflex saves.</p>
Form of the Dragon I	Form of the Dragon I	transmutation (polymorph)	sorcerer/wizard 6	1 standard action	V, S, M (a scale of the dragon type you plan to assume)	personal	you	1 min./level (D)	see text	no	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You become a Medium chromatic or metallic dragon.

You also gain one bite (1d8), two claws (1d6), and two wing attacks (1d4). Your breath weapon and resistance depend on the type of dragon. You can only use the breath weapon once per casting of this spell. All breath weapons deal 6d8 points of damage and allow a Reflex save for half damage.

You gain the following abilities: a +10 size bonus to Strength, a +8 size bonus to Constitution, a +8 natural armor bonus, fly 120 feet (poor), blindsense 60 feet, darkvision 120 feet, a breath weapon, DR 10/magic, frightful presence (DC equal to the DC for this spell), and immunity to one element (of the same type <i>form of the dragon I </i>grants resistance to). You also gain one bite (2d8), two claws (2d6), two wing attacks (1d8), and one tail slap attack (2d6). You can use the breath weapon as often as you like, but you must wait 1d4 rounds between uses. All breath weapons deal 12d8 points of damage and allow a Reflex save for half damage. Line breath weapons increase to 100-foot lines and cones increase to 50-foot cones.</p><h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Each <i>mythic form of the dragon</i> spell must be learned individually, and you must know the respective non-mythic <i>form of the dragon</i> spell to learn its mythic version. You don't have to learn them in order, and aren't required to know a lower-level <i>mythic form of the dragon</i> spell before you learn a higher-level one (for example, you can learn <i>mythic form of the dragon II </i>if you know <i>form of the dragon II</i>, even if you don't know <i>mythic form of the dragon I</i>). Each <i>mythic form of the dragon</i> spell adds the following benefits to its respective non-mythic version.</p><p>The spell's bonuses to ability scores increase by 2, the natural armor bonus increases by 1, and the breath weapon damage increases to 10d6. All of the dragon form's natural attacks increase by one step (see Improved Natural Attack).</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (3rd)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the ability score bonuses increase by an additional 2. During each casting of the spell, you can revert to your normal form or back to your dragon form without ending the spell a number of times equal to your tier.</p>
Gaseous Form	Gaseous Form	transmutation	bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3	1 standard action	S, M/DF (a bit of gauze and a wisp of smoke)	touch	willing corporeal creature touched	2 min./level (D)	none	no	<h>Normal Use</h><p>The subject and all its gear become insubstantial, misty, and translucent. Its material armor (including natural armor) becomes worthless, though its size, Dexterity, deflection bonuses, and armor bonuses from force effects still apply. The subject gains DR 10/magic and becomes immune to poison, sneak attacks, and critical hits. It can't attack or cast spells with verbal, somatic, material, or focus components while in gaseous form. This does not rule out the use of certain spells that the subject may have prepared using the feats Silent Spell, Still Spell, and Eschew Materials. The subject also loses supernatural abilities while in gaseous form. If it has a touch spell ready to use, that spell is discharged harmlessly when the <i>gaseous form </i>spell takes effect.</p><p>A gaseous creature can't run, but it can fly at a speed of 10 feet and automatically succeeds on all Fly skill checks. It can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, with all it was wearing or holding in its hands, as long as the spell persists. The creature is subject to the effects of wind, and it can't enter water or other liquid. It also can't manipulate objects or activate items, even those carried along with its gaseous form. Continuously active items remain active, though in some cases their effects may be moot.</p>
Giant Vermin	Giant Vermin	transmutation	cleric 4, druid 4	1 standard action	V, S, DF	close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	1 or more vermin, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart	1 min./level	none	yes	"<h>Normal Use</h><p>You turn a number of normal-sized centipedes, scorpions, or spiders into their giant counterparts. Only one type of vermin can be transmuted (so a single casting cannot affect both a centipede and a spider). The number of vermin which can be affected by this spell depends on your caster level, as noted on the table below.</p><p>Giant vermin created by this spell do not attempt to harm you, but your control of such creatures is limited to simple commands (""Attack,"" ""Defend,"" ""Stop,"" and so forth). Orders to attack a certain creature when it appears or guard against a particular occurrence are too complex for the vermin to understand. Unless commanded to do otherwise, the giant vermin attack whomever or whatever is near them.</p>"
Globe of Invulnerability	Globe of Invulnerability	abjuration	sorcerer/wizard 6	1 standard action	V, S, M (a glass or crystal bead)	10 ft.	10-ft.-radius spherical emanation, centered on you	1 round/level (D)	none	no	<h>Normal Use</h><p>This spell functions like <i>lesser globe of invulnerability, </i>except that it also excludes 4th-level spells and spell-like effects.</p><h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Add half your tier to the level of non-mythic spells the globe excludes. The globe excludes mythic spells of 4th level or lower.</p>
Glyph of Warding	Glyph of Warding	abjuration	cleric 3	10 minutes	V, S, M (powdered diamond worth 200 gp)	touch	object touched or up to 5 sq. ft./level	permanent until discharged (D)	see text	no (object) and yes; see text	<h>Normal Use</h><p>This powerful inscription harms those who enter, pass, or open the warded area or object. A <i>glyph of warding </i>can guard a bridge or passage, ward a portal, trap a chest or box, and so on.</p><p>You set all of the conditions of the ward. Typically, any creature entering the warded area or opening the warded object without speaking a password (which you set when casting the spell) is subject to the magic it stores. Alternatively or in addition to a password trigger, glyphs can be set according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature type, subtype, or kind. Glyphs can also be set with respect to good, evil, law, or chaos, or to pass those of your religion. They cannot be set according to class, HD, or level. Glyphs respond to invisible creatures normally but are not triggered by those who travel past them ethereally. Multiple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area. However, if a cabinet has three different drawers, each can be separately warded.</p><p>When casting the spell, you weave a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. A glyph can be placed to conform to any shape up to the limitations of your total square footage. When the spell is completed, the glyph and tracery become nearly invisible.</p><p>Glyphs cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they can be dispelled. <i>Mislead</i>, <i>polymorph</i>, and <i>nondetection </i>(and similar magical effects) can fool a glyph, though nonmagical disguises and the like can't. <i>Read magic </i>allows you to identify a <i>glyph of warding </i>with a DC 13 Knowledge (arcana) check. Identifying the glyph does not discharge it and allows you to know the basic nature of the glyph (version, type of damage caused, what spell is stored).</p><p><i>Note</i>: Magic traps such as <i>glyph of warding </i>are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use Perception to find a glyph, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to disarm it</p>
Goodberry	Goodberry	transmutation	druid 1	1 standard action	V, S, DF	touch	2d4 fresh berries touched	1 day/level	none	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>Casting <i>goodberry </i>makes 2d4 freshly picked berries magical. You (as well as any other druid of 3rd or higher level) can immediately discern which berries are affected. Each transmuted berry provides nourishment as if it were a normal meal for a Medium creature. The berry also cures 1 point of damage when eaten, subject to a maximum of 8 points of such curing in any 24-hour period.</p>
Grease	Grease	conjuration (creation)	bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1	1 standard action	V, S, M (butter)	close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	one object or 10-ft. square	1 min./level (D)	see text	no	<h>Normal Use</h><p>A <i>grease </i>spell covers a solid surface with a layer of slippery grease. Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a successful Reflex save or fall. A creature can walk within or through the area of grease at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means it can't move that round (and must then make a Reflex save or fall), while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Acrobatics skill for details). Creatures that do not move on their turn do not need to make this check and are not considered flat-footed.</p><p>The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item. Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while an object wielded or employed by a creature requires its bearer to make a Reflex saving throw to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made in each round that the creature attempts to pick up or use the <i>greased </i>item. A creature wearing <i>greased </i>armor or clothing gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks made to escape a grapple, and to their CMD to avoid being grappled.</p><h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>If you cast <i>mythic grease</i> on an area, add your tier to the Acrobatics DC to move within or through the area. If you cast it on a creature's armor or clothing, add your tier to its Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks attempted to escape a grapple and to its CMD to avoid being grappled.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented</h>: You can expend two uses of mythic power to make the grease flammable. It ignites from any fire at least the size of a candle flame. If a greased area is ignited, any creature in the area on your turn takes 1d3 points of fire damage and might catch on fire. If a greased creature is ignited, it takes 2d6 points of fire damage, and might catch on fire; add your tier to the save DC.</p>
Guards and Wards	Guards and Wards	abjuration	sorcerer/wizard 6	30 minutes	V, S, M (burning incense, a small measure of brimstone and oil, a knotted string, and a small amount of blood), F (a small silver rod)	anywhere within the area to be warded	up to 200 sq. ft./level (S)	2 hours/level (D)	see text	see text	<h>Normal Use</h><p>This powerful spell is primarily used to defend a stronghold or fortress by creating a number of magical wards and effects. The ward protects 200 square feet per caster level. The warded area can be as much as 20 feet high, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them; you must be somewhere within the area to be warded to cast the spell. The spell creates the following magical effects within the warded area.</p><p><i>Fog</i>: Fog fills all corridors, obscuring all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). Saving Throw: none. Spell Resistance: no.</p><p><i>Arcane Locks</i>: All doors in the warded area are <i>arcane locked. </i>Saving Throw: none. Spell Resistance: no.</p><p><i>Webs</i>: Webs fill all stairs from top to bottom. These strands are identical with those created by the <i>web </i>spell, except that they regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while the <i>guards and wards </i>spell lasts. Saving Throw: Reflex negates; see text for <i>web</i>. Spell Resistance: no.</p><p><i>Confusion</i>: Where there are choices in direction--;such as a corridor intersection or side passage--;a minor <i>confusion-</i>type effect functions so as to make it 50% probable that intruders believe they are going in the opposite direction from the one they actually chose. This is a mind-affecting effect. Saving Throw: none. Spell Resistance: yes.</p><p><i>Lost Doors</i>: One door per caster level is covered by a <i>silent image </i>to appear as if it were a plain wall. Saving Throw: Will disbelief (if interacted with). Spell Resistance: no.</p><p>In addition, you can place your choice of one of the following five magical effects.</p><p>1. <i>Dancing lights </i>in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that causes the lights to repeat as long as the <i>guards and wards </i>spell lasts. Saving Throw: none. Spell Resistance: no.</p><p>2. A <i>magic mouth </i>in two places. Saving Throw: none. Spell Resistance: no.</p><p>3. A <i>stinking cloud </i>in two places. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while the <i>guards and wards </i>spell lasts. Saving Throw: Fortitude negates; see text for <i>stinking cloud. </i>Spell Resistance: no.</p><p>4. A <i>gust of wind </i>in one corridor or room. Saving Throw: Fortitude negates. Spell Resistance: yes.</p><p>5. A <i>suggestion </i>in one place. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature who enters or passes through the area receives the <i>suggestion </i>mentally. Saving Throw: Will negates. Spell Resistance: yes.</p><p>The whole warded area radiates strong magic of the abjuration school. A <i>dispel magic </i>cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect. A successful <i>mage's disjunction </i>destroys the entire <i>guards and wards </i>effect.</p>
Gust of Wind	Gust of Wind	evocation [air]	druid 2, sorcerer/wizard 2	1 standard action	V, S	60 ft.	line-shaped gust of severe wind emanating out from you to the extreme of the range	1 round	Fortitude negates	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>This spell creates a severe blast of air (approximately 50 mph) that originates from you, affecting all creatures in its path. All flying creatures in this area take a -4 penalty on Fly skill checks. Tiny or smaller flying creatures must make a DC 25 Fly skill check or be blown back 2d6 x 10 feet and take 2d6 points of damage. Small or smaller flying creatures must make a DC 20 Fly skill check to move against the force of the wind.</p><p>A Tiny or smaller creature on the ground is knocked down and rolled 1d4 x 10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet.</p><p>Small creatures are knocked prone by the force of the wind.</p><p>Medium or smaller creatures are unable to move forward against the force of the wind unless they succeed at a DC 15 Strength check.</p><p>Large or larger creatures may move normally within a <i>gust of wind </i>effect.</p><p>This spell can't move a creature beyond the limit of its range.</p><p>Any creature, regardless of size, takes a -4 penalty on ranged attacks and Perception checks in the area of a <i>gust of wind</i>.</p><p>The force of the gust automatically extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. It causes protected flames, such as those in lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50% chance to extinguish those lights.</p><p>In addition to the effects noted, a <i>gust of wind </i>can do anything that a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do. It can create a stinging spray of sand or dust, fan a large fire, overturn delicate awnings or hangings, heel over a small boat, and blow gases or vapors to the edge of its range.</p><p><i>Gust of wind </i>can be made permanent with a <i>permanency </i>spell.</p>
Harm	Harm	necromancy	cleric 6	1 standard action	V, S	touch	creature touched	instantaneous	Will half; see text	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p><i>Harm </i>charges a subject with negative energy that deals 10 points of damage per caster level (to a maximum of 150 points at 15th level).

This extra speed has several effects.</p><p>When making a full attack action, a hasted creature may make one extra attack with one natural or manufactured weapon. The attack is made using the creature's full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by a <i>speed</i> weapon, nor does it actually grant an extra action, so you can't use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round.)</p><p>A hasted creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. Any condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.</p><p>All of the hasted creature's modes of movement (including land movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the subject's normal speed using that form of movement. This increase counts as an enhancement bonus, and it affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for increased speed. Multiple <i>haste </i>effects don't stack. <i>Haste </i>dispels and counters <i>slow.</i></p>

It also cures 10 hit points of damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 150 points at 15th level.</p><p><i>Heal </i>does not remove negative levels or restore permanently drained ability score points.</p><p>If used against an undead creature, <i>heal </i>instead acts like <i>harm</i>.</p>
Healing Thief	Healing Thief	necromancy	sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3	1 standard action	V, S, M (a bit of sponge, damp with tears)	touch	creature touched	1 round/level or until discharged	none	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>With this spell you can steal the healing of the target creature. You must succeed at a melee touch attack to strike the target. If you do, until the effect ends, whenever your target is subject to a healing spell or a supernatural effect that heals hit points, the target only receives half the healing (rounded down) and you receive the other half (also rounded down). You must remain within 25 feet (plus 5 feet per two caster levels) of the target to gain this benefit. If you move outside that range, the spell is discharged. Once you steal 5 hit points per your caster level (maximum 50 hit points) of healing from this spell's effect, the spell is discharged.</p><h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Instead of stealing half the target's healing, you steal all of it. The amount of damage you steal before the spell is discharged increases to 10 points per caster level (maximum 100 points).</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (3rd)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the range of the spell changes to close (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels). If the target has fast healing or regeneration, you steal half of its fast healing or regeneration. Healing from these abilities count toward the maximum healing stolen before the spell is discharged.</p>

Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no saving throw. Magical metal is allowed a saving throw against the spell. An item in a creature's possession uses the creature's saving throw bonus unless its own is higher.</p><p>A creature takes fire damage if its equipment is heated. It takes full damage if its armor, shield, or weapon is affected. The creature takes minimum damage (1 point or 2 points; see the table) if it's not wearing or wielding such an item.</p><p>On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes warm and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage. The same effect also occurs on the last round of the spell's duration. During the second (and also the next-to-last) round, intense heat causes pain and damage. In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is searing hot, and causes more damage, as shown on the table below.</p><p>Any cold intense enough to damage the creature negates fire damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis.

It collapses into gales of manic laughter, falling prone. The subject can take no actions while laughing, but is not considered helpless. After the spell ends, it can act normally.

If this save is successful, the effect ends. If not, the creature continues laughing for the entire duration.</p><p>A creature with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower is not affected.

Creatures so banished cannot return for at least 24 hours. This effect takes place regardless of whether the creatures hear the <i>holy word</i> or not<i>. </i>The banishment effect allows a Will save (at a -4 penalty) to negate.</p><p>Creatures whose HD exceed your caster level are unaffected by <i>holy word.</i></p>

Invisibility	Invisibility	illusion (glamer)	bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2	1 standard action	V, S, M/DF (an eyelash encased in gum arabic)	personal or touch	you or a creature or object weighing no more than 100 lbs./level	1 min./level (D)	Will negates (harmless) or Will negates (harmless, object)	yes (harmless) or yes (harmless, object)	<h>Normal Use</h><p>The creature or object touched becomes invisible. If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so.</p><p>Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible.</p><p>Of course, the subject is not magically silenced<i>, </i>and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as swimming in water or stepping in a puddle). If a check is required, a stationary invisible creature has a +40 bonus on its Stealth checks. This bonus is reduced to +20 if the creature is moving. The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions. Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as <i>bless </i>that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.</p><p><i>Invisibility </i>can be made permanent (on objects only) with a <i>permanency </i>spell.</p>
Irresistible Dance	Irresistible Dance	enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]	bard 6, sorcerer/wizard 8	1 standard action	V	touch	living creature touched	1d4+1 rounds	Will partial	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>The subject feels an undeniable urge to dance and begins doing so, complete with foot shuffling and tapping. The spell effect makes it impossible for the subject to do anything other than caper and prance in place. The effect imposes a -4 penalty to Armor Class and a -10 penalty on Reflex saves, and it negates any AC bonus granted by a shield the target holds. The dancing subject provokes attacks of opportunity each round on its turn. A successful Will save reduces the duration of this effect to 1 round.</p>
Jitterbugs	Jitterbugs	illusion (figment) [mind-affecting]	bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 2	1 standard action	V, S	short (25 ft. +5 ft. 2/levels)	one creature	1 round/level	Will negates	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You cause the target to perceive itself as being covered in creeping, crawling, stinging bugs. This causes the target to become jittery and unable to stay still, forcing it to constantly move and twitch. The target takes a -4 penalty on all Dexterity checks and Dexterity-based skill checks, and cannot take the delay, ready, or total defense actions.</p><h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Starting on the second round of the spell, the affected target must succeed at a Fortitude save on your turn or be nauseated for 1 round, as if distracted by an actual swarm.</p>
Knock	Knock	transmutation	sorcerer/wizard 2	1 standard action	V	medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	one door, box, or chest with an area of up to 10 sq. ft./level	instantaneous; see text	none	no	<h>Normal Use</h><p><i>Knock </i>opens stuck, barred, or locked doors, as well as those subject to <i>hold portal </i>or <i>arcane lock</i>. When you complete the casting of this spell, make a caster level check against the DC of the lock with a +10 bonus. If successful, <i>knock </i>opens up to two means of closure. This spell opens secret doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains (provided they serve to hold something shut). If used to open an <i>arcane locked </i>door, the spell does not remove the <i>arcane lock </i>but simply suspends its functioning for 10 minutes. In all other cases, the door does not relock itself or become stuck again on its own. <i>Knock </i>does not raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like. The effect is limited by the area. Each casting can undo as many as two means of preventing access. </p>
Know the Enemy	Know the Enemy	divination	cleric 1, inquisitor 1, paladin 1, ranger 1	1 minute	S, V, DF	personal	you	instantaneous	none	no	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You commune with the divine, reflecting on one type of creature you encountered in the last day. You may make a Knowledge check regarding that creature type with a +10 insight bonus.</p>

If the target is unable to expend mythic power, it can't activate any part of the ability that requires expending uses of mythic power, but the ability otherwise functions as if the creature were 1st tier.</p><p>While your path ability is transferred in this way, you can't use it yourself (even if it's an automatic ability or one that doesn't require expending uses of mythic power).</p>
Levitate	Levitate	transmutation	sorcerer/wizard 2	1 standard action	V, S, F (a leather loop or golden wire bent into a cup shape)	personal or close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	you or one willing creature or one object (total weight up to 100 lbs./level)	1 min./level (D)	none	no	<h>Normal Use</h><p><i>Levitate </i>allows you to move yourself, another creature, or an object up and down as you wish. A creature must be willing to be levitated<i>, </i>and an object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature. You can mentally direct the recipient to move up or down as much as 20 feet each round; doing so is a move action. You cannot move the recipient horizontally, but the recipient could clamber along the face of a cliff, for example, or push against a ceiling to move laterally (generally at half its base land speed).</p><p>A levitating creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack has a -1 penalty on attack rolls, the second -2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of -5. A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at -1.</p>
Lightning Arc	Lightning Arc	evocation [electricity]	sorcerer/wizard 5	1 standard action	V, S, M (fur and two glass figurines)	long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)	two creatures or objects which must be no more than 60 ft. apart	instantaneous	Reflex half	yes (see text)	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You generate an arc of lightning between two targets. The lightning deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) to both targets and any creatures in a line connecting them. The spell fails if there is no line of effect between the targets. <i>Lightning arc</i> sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in its path. It can melt metals that have a low melting point, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, or bronze.</p>
Limited Wish	Limited Wish	universal	sorcerer/wizard 7	1 standard action	V, S, M (diamond worth 1,500 gp)	see text	see text	see text	none, see text	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>A <i>limited wish </i>lets you create nearly any type of effect. For example, a <i>limited wish </i>can do any of the following things.</p><p>A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DC is for a 7th-level spell. When a <i>limited wish </i>spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 1,000 gp, you must provide that component (in addition to the 1,500 gp diamond component for this spell).</p>
Mage Armor	Mage Armor	conjuration (creation) [force]	sorcerer/wizard 1	1 standard action	V, S, F (a piece of cured leather)	touch	creature touched	1 hour/level (D)	Will negates (harmless)	no	<h>Normal Use</h><p>An invisible but tangible field of force surrounds the subject of a <i>mage armor </i>spell, providing a +4 armor bonus to AC.</p><p>Unlike mundane armor, <i>mage armor </i>entails no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed reduction. Since <i>mage armor </i>is made of force, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal armor.</p>
Mage's Disjunction	Mage's Disjunction	abjuration	sorcerer/wizard 9	1 standard action	V	close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	all magical effects and magic items within a 40-ft.-radius burst, or one magic item (see text)	1 minute/level	Will negates (object)	no	<h>Normal Use</h><p>All magical effects and magic items within the radius of the spell, except for those that you carry or touch, are disjoined. That is, spells and spell-like effects are unraveled and destroyed completely (ending the effect as a <i>dispel magic </i>spell does), and each permanent magic item must make a successful Will save or be turned into a normal item for the duration of this spell. An item in a creature's possession uses its own Will save bonus or its possessor's Will save bonus, whichever is higher. If an item's saving throw results in a natural 1 on the die, the item is destroyed instead of being suppressed.</p><p>You also have a 1% chance per caster level of destroying an <i>antimagic field. </i>If the <i>antimagic field </i>survives the <i>disjunction, </i>no items within it are disjoined.</p><p>You can also use this spell to target a single item. The item gets a Will save at a -5 penalty to avoid being permanently destroyed. Even artifacts are subject to <i>mage's disjunction, </i>though there is only a 1% chance per caster level of actually affecting such powerful items. If successful, the artifact's power unravels, and it is destroyed (with no save). If an artifact is destroyed, you must make a DC 25 Will save or permanently lose all spellcasting abilities. These abilities cannot be recovered by mortal magic, not even <i>miracle </i>or <i>wish</i>. Destroying artifacts is a dangerous business, and it is 95% likely to attract the attention of some powerful being who has an interest in or connection with the device.</p>
Magic Fang	Magic Fang	transmutation	druid 1, ranger 1	1 standard action	V, S, DF	touch	living creature touched	1 min./level	Will negates (harmless)	yes (harmless)	<h>Normal Use</h><p><i>Magic fang </i>gives one natural weapon or unarmed strike of the subject a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. The spell can affect a slam attack, fist, bite, or other natural weapon. The spell does not change an unarmed strike's damage from nonlethal damage to lethal damage.</p><p><i>Magic fang </i>can be made permanent with a <i>permanency </i>spell.</p>
Magic Fang, Greater	Magic Fang	transmutation	druid 3, ranger 3	1 standard action	V, S, DF	touch	one living creature	1hour/level	Will negates (harmless)	yes (harmless)	<h>Normal Use</h> <p>This spell functions like <i>magic fang</i>, except that the enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls is +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5). This bonus does not allow a natural weapon or unarmed strike to bypass damage reduction aside from magic.</p> <p>Alternatively, you may imbue all of the creature's natural weapons with a +1 enhancement bonus (regardless of your caster level).</p> <p><i>Greater magic fang </i>can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i>spell.</p>
Magic Missile	Magic Missile	evocation [force]	sorcerer/wizard 1	1 standard action	V, S	medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	up to five creatures, no two of which can be more than 15 ft. apart	instantaneous	none	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>A missile of magical energy darts forth from your fingertip and strikes its target, dealing 1d4+1 points of force damage.</p><p>The missile strikes unerringly, even if the target is in melee combat, so long as it has less than total cover or total concealment. Specific parts of a creature can't be singled out. Objects are not damaged by the spell.</p><p>For every two caster levels beyond 1st, you gain an additional missile--;two at 3rd level, three at 5th, four at 7th, and the maximum of five missiles at 9th level or higher. If you shoot multiple missiles, you can have them strike a single creature or several creatures. A single missile can strike only one creature. You must designate targets before you check for spell resistance or roll damage.</p>
Magic Vestment	Magic Vestment	transmutation	cleric 3	1 standard action	V, S, DF	touch	armor or shield touched	1 hour/level	Will negates (harmless, object)	yes (harmless, object)	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You imbue a suit of armor or a shield with an enhancement bonus of +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5 at 20th level).</p><p>An outfit of regular clothing counts as armor that grants no AC bonus for the purpose of this spell.</p>
Magic Weapon, Greater	Magic Weapon	transmutation	cleric 4, paladin 3, sorcerer/wizard 3	1 standard action	V, S, M/DF (powdered lime and carbon)	close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	one weapon or 50 projectiles (all of which must be together at the time of casting)	1 hour/level	Will negates (harmless, object)	yes (harmless, object)	<h>Normal Use</h><p>This spell functions like <i>magic weapon, </i>except that it gives a weapon an enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls of +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5). This bonus does not allow a weapon to bypass damage reduction aside from magic.</p> <p>Alternatively, you can affect as many as 50 arrows, bolts, or bullets. The projectiles must be of the same kind, and they have to be together (in the same quiver or other container). Projectiles, but not thrown weapons, lose their transmutation after they are used. Treat shuriken as projectiles, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell.</p>
Make Whole	Make Whole	transmutation	cleric 2, sorcerer/wizard 2	10 minutes	V, S	close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	one object of up to 10 cu. ft./level or one construct creature of any size	instantaneous	Will negates (harmless, object)	yes (harmless, object)	<h>Normal Use</h><p>This spell functions as <i>mending</i>, except that it repairs 1d6 points of damage per level when cast on an object or construct creature (maximum 5d6).</p><p><i>Make whole</i> can fix destroyed magic items (at 0 hit points or less), and restores the magic properties of the item if your caster level is at least twice that of the item. Items with charges (such as wands) and single-use items (such as potions and scrolls) cannot be repaired in this way. When <i>make whole</i> is used on a construct creature, the spell bypasses any immunity to magic as if the spell did not allow spell resistance.</p><h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage the spell repairs increases to 2d6 points of damage per caster level when cast on a construct creature (maximum 10d6). A construct repaired with this spell gains a +2 enhancement bonus on an ability score of your choice for the next 24 hours. To repair a magic item, your caster level has to equal to only the caster level of the magic item, not double the caster level.</p>
Maze	Maze	conjuration (teleportation)	sorcerer/wizard 8	1 standard action	V, S	close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	one creature	see text	none	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You banish the subject into an extradimensional labyrinth. Each round on its turn, it may attempt a DC 20 Intelligence check to escape the labyrinth as a full-round action. If the subject doesn't escape, the maze disappears after 10 minutes, freeing the subject.</p><p>On escaping or leaving the maze, the subject reappears where it had been when the <i>maze </i>spell was cast. If this location is filled with a solid object, the subject appears in the nearest open space. Spells and abilities that move a creature within a plane, such as <i>teleport </i>and <i>dimension door, </i>do not help a creature escape a <i>maze </i>spell, although a <i>plane shift </i>spell allows it to exit to whatever plane is designated in that spell. Minotaurs are not affected by this spell.</p>
Memory Lapse	Memory Lapse	enchantment [mind-affecting]	bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1	1 standard action	V, S	close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	one living creature 	instantaneous	Will negates	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You cause the target to forget what happened from the casting of the spell back to the beginning of its last turn. This may allow a retry on a Diplomacy, Intimidate, or opposed skill check, though only with respect to the target, not other creatures that may be present.</p>
Meteor Swarm	Meteor Swarm	evocation [fire]	sorcerer/wizard 9	1 standard action	V, S	long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)	four 40-ft.-radius spreads, see text	instantaneous	none or Reflex half, see text	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p><i>Meteor swarm </i>is a very powerful and spectacular spell that is similar to <i>fireball </i>in many aspects. When you cast it, four 2-foot-diameter spheres spring from your outstretched hand and streak in straight lines to the spots you select. The meteor spheres leave a fiery trail of sparks.</p><p>If you aim a sphere at a specific creature, you may make a ranged touch attack to strike the target with the meteor. Any creature struck by a sphere takes 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage (no save) and takes a -4 penalty on the saving throw against the sphere's fire damage (see below). If a targeted sphere misses its target, it simply explodes at the nearest corner of the target's space. You may aim more than one sphere at the same target.</p><p>Once a sphere reaches its destination, it explodes in a 40-foot-radius spread, dealing 6d6 points of fire damage to each creature in the area. If a creature is within the area of more than one sphere, it must save separately against each. Despite stemming from separate spheres, all of the fire damage is added together after the saves have been made, and fire resistance is applied only once.</p>
Mighty Fist of the Earth	Mighty Fist of the Earth	conjuration (creation) [earth]	cleric 1, druid 1	1 standard action	V, S, DF	close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	one creature	instantaneous	none	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You create a fist-sized rock that flies toward one enemy. Make an unarmed strike attack roll against the target as if it were in your threatened area. If the attack is successful, the rock deals bludgeoning damage to the target as if you had hit the target with your unarmed strike. If you have a <i>ki</i> pool, as long as you have at least 1 point in your <i>ki</i> pool, the rock counts as a <i>ki</i> strike.</p><p>At 4th level, a qinggong monk  may select this spell as a <i>ki</i> power costing 1 <i>ki</i> point to activate (if the monk has 0 <i>ki</i> points after activating this <i>ki</i> power, the rock does not count as a <i>ki</i> strike).</p><h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Add your tier to the rock's attack roll and damage roll. Increase the critical multiplier of the attack by 1 (maximum x4).</p>
Mirror Image	Mirror Image	illusion (figment)	bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2	1 standard action	V, S	personal	you	1 min./level	none	none	<h>Normal Use</h><p>This spell creates a number of illusory doubles of you that inhabit your square. These doubles make it difficult for enemies to precisely locate and attack you. </p><p>When <i>mirror image </i>is cast, 1d4 images plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images total) are created. These images remain in your space and move with you, mimicking your movements, sounds, and actions exactly. Whenever you are attacked or are the target of a spell that requires an attack roll, there is a possibility that the attack targets one of your images instead. If the attack is a hit, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. If it is a figment, the figment is destroyed. If the attack misses by 5 or less, one of your figments is destroyed by the near miss. Area spells affect you normally and do not destroy any of your figments. Spells and effects that do not require an attack roll affect you normally and do not destroy any of your figments. Spells that require a touch attack are harmlessly discharged if used to destroy a figment.</p><p>An attacker must be able to see the figments to be fooled. If you are invisible or the attacker is blind, the spell has no effect (although the normal miss chances still apply).</p><h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The maximum number of images generated by this spell increases to 12. Destroying an image creates a flash of light. Any creature that destroys an image must succeed at a Will save or be dazzled for 1 round.</p>
Mislead	Mislead	illusion (figment, glamer)	bard 5, sorcerer/wizard 6	1 standard action	S	close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	you/one illusory double	1 round/level (D) and concentration + 3 rounds; see text	none or Will disbelief (if interacted with); see text	no	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You become invisible (as <i>greater invisibility</i>, a glamer), and at the same time, an illusory double of you (as <i>major image, </i>a figment) appears. You are then free to go elsewhere while your double moves away. The double appears within range but thereafter moves as you direct it (which requires concentration beginning on the first round after the casting). You can make the figment appear superimposed perfectly over your own body so that observers don't notice an image appearing and you turning invisible. You and the figment can then move in different directions. The double moves at your speed and can talk and gesture as if it were real, but it cannot attack or cast spells, though it can pretend to do so.</p><p>The illusory double lasts as long as you concentrate upon it, plus 3 additional rounds. After you cease concentration, the illusory double continues to carry out the same activity until the duration expires. The <i>greater invisibility </i>lasts for 1 round per level, regardless of concentration.</p>
Modify Memory	Modify Memory	enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]	bard 4	1 round; see text	V, S	close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	one living creature	permanent	Will negates	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You reach into the subject's mind and modify as many as 5 minutes of its memories in one of the following ways.</p><p>Casting the spell takes 1 round. If the subject fails to save, you proceed with the spell by spending as much as 5 minutes (a period of time equal to the amount of memory you want to modify) visualizing the memory you wish to modify in the subject. If your concentration is disturbed before the visualization is complete, or if the subject is ever beyond the spell's range during this time, the spell is lost.</p><p>A modified memory does not necessarily affect the subject's actions, particularly if it contradicts the creature's natural inclinations. An illogical modified memory is dismissed by the creature as a bad dream, too much wine, or another similar excuse. </p>

Move Earth	Move Earth	transmutation [earth]	druid 6, sorcerer/wizard 6	see text	V, S, M (clay, loam, sand, and an iron blade)	long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)	dirt in an area up to 750 ft. square and up to 10 ft. deep (S)	instantaneous	none	no	<h>Normal Use</h><p><i>Move earth </i>moves dirt (clay, loam, sand, and soil), possibly collapsing embankments, moving hillocks, shifting dunes, and so forth.</p><p>In no event can rock formations be collapsed or moved. The area to be affected determines the casting time. For every 150-foot square (up to 10 feet deep), casting takes 10 minutes. The maximum area, 750 feet by 750 feet, takes 4 hours and 10 minutes to move.</p><p>This spell does not violently break the surface of the ground. Instead, it creates wavelike crests and troughs, with the earth reacting with glacial fluidity until the desired result is achieved. Trees, structures, rock formations, and such are mostly unaffected except for changes in elevation and relative topography.</p><p>The spell cannot be used for tunneling and is generally too slow to trap or bury creatures. Its primary use is for digging or filling moats or for adjusting terrain contours before a battle.</p><p>This spell has no effect on earth creatures.</p>

The target attacks its nearest ally on its next turn with a melee weapon or natural weapon. If necessary, it moves to or charges to the nearest ally in order to make this attack. If it is unable to reach its closest ally on its next turn, the target uses its turn to get as close as possible to the ally.</p>
Mythic Severance	Mythic Severance	necromancy [curse]	cleric 4, inquisitor 3, sorcerer/wizard 4, witch 4	1 standard action	V, S	close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	one creature	permanent	Will negates	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You restrict the target's access to its mythic power. Each time the target attempts to cast a mythic spell, expend mythic power to activate a path ability, or use any other effect that requires expending uses of mythic power, it must attempt a Will saving throw against the DC of this spell. If it fails this saving throw, the creature loses its action and the ability it was attempting to use has no effect.</p><p>This spell has no effect on mythic abilities that don't require the target to expend mythic power.</p>
Named Bullet	Named Bullet	divination	inquisitor 4, ranger 3, sorcerer/wizard 4, witch 4	1 standard action	V, S, M/DF (an item from the selected creature or creature type)	touch	one piece of ammunition or one thrown weapon	10 minutes/level or until discharged	Will negates (harmless, object)	yes (harmless, object)	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You imbue the target with deadly accuracy against a selected creature type (and subtype for humanoids or outsiders) or a specific creature you know and can name. When used against the selected creature, the ammunition never misfires and is unaffected by concealment (but not total concealment), and at a range of 30 feet or less, the attack targets the selected creature's touch AC. When the target hits the selected creature, you must overcome that creature's spell resistance, or this spell has no effect. A normal hit scored using the target against the selected creature is considered to be a critical threat and deals 1 extra point of damage per caster level (maximum 20), which is not multiplied on a critical hit. A natural critical hit deals the same extra damage, but that damage is multiplied due to the critical.</p><p>Once the target is used to attack the selected creature, successfully or not, this spell is discharged.</p>

The <i>nightmare </i>leaves the subject fatigued and unable to regain arcane spells for the next 24 hours.</p><p>The difficulty of the save depends on your knowledge the subject and the physical connection (if any) you have to that creature.</p><p><i>Dispel evil </i>cast on the subject while you are casting the spell dispels the <i>nightmare </i>and causes you to be stunned for 10 minutes per caster level of the <i>dispel evil</i>.</p><p>If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, you can choose to cease casting (ending the spell) or to enter a trance until the recipient goes to sleep, whereupon you become alert again and complete the casting. If you are disturbed during the trance, you must succeed on a Concentration check as if you were in the midst of casting a spell or the spell ends.</p><p>If you choose to enter a trance, you are not aware of your surroundings or the activities around you while in the trance.</p><p>You are defenseless, both physically and mentally, while in the trance. (You always fail Reflex and Will saving throws, for example.)</p><p>Creatures who don't sleep (such as outsiders) or dream are immune to this spell.</p>

For as long as you are subject to this spell, you gain a +5 sacred bonus to AC and on saving throws, as well as DR 10/evil. If you make a direct or indirect attack or any show any hostility toward any creature, the spell immediately ends. </p><h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>You don't provoke attacks of opportunity when you attempt Heal checks, cast targeted spells with the harmless descriptor, or use positive energy effects to heal living creatures.</p>

It is stationary. The vapor obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target).</p><p>A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a <i>gust of wind </i>spell, disperses the fog in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. A <i>fireball, flame strike</i>, or similar spell burns away the fog in the explosive or fiery spell's area. A <i>wall of fire </i>burns away the fog in the area into which it deals damage.</p><p>This spell does not function underwater.</p>
Orb of the Void	Orb of the Void	necromancy	cleric 8, sorcerer/wizard 8	1 standard action	V, S, M (a black gemstone of any kind worth 50 gp)	close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	1-ft.-diameter sphere	1 round/level (D)	Fortitude negates	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You create a small weightless sphere of pure negative energy. As a move action, you can move it up to 30 feet per round in any direction. If it enters a space with a living creature, it stops moving for the round and that creature gains one negative level (Fortitude negates). Any creature passing through or ending its turn in the space occupied by the sphere gains one negative level (Fortitude negates). Twenty-four hours after gaining a negative level from the sphere, the subject must make a Fortitude saving throw (the DC of this save is equal to the DC of this spell) for each negative level. If the save succeeds, that negative level is removed. If it fails, that negative level becomes permanent.</p><p>If more than one orb (from different castings of the spell) enters the same space, the orbs automatically fuse together. The resulting orb uses the higher of the two orbs' DCs as its DC and whichever duration has more time left. If the orbs are from different casters, each must make an opposed Intelligence check to move the sphere.</p><p>An undead creature that passes through or ends its turn in the space occupied by the orb gains 2d4 x 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour.</p>
Order's Wrath	Order's Wrath	evocation [lawful]	cleric 4	1 standard action	V, S	medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	nonlawful creatures within a burst that fills a 30-ft. cube	instantaneous (1 round); see text	Will partial; see text	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You channel lawful power to smite enemies. The power takes the form of a three-dimensional grid of energy. Only chaotic and neutral (not lawful) creatures are harmed by the spell.</p><p>The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to chaotic creatures (or 1d6 points of damage per caster level, maximum 10d6, to chaotic outsiders) and causes them to be dazed for 1 round. A successful Will save reduces the damage to half and negates the daze effect.</p><p>The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither chaotic nor lawful, and they are not dazed. They can reduce the damage in half again (down to one-quarter of the roll) with a successful Will save.</p>
Pernicious Poison	Pernicious Poison	necromancy [poison]	antipaladin 2, druid 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2	1 standard action	V, S, DF	touch	creature touched	10 minute/level	none	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You weaken the target's defenses against poison. The target gains a -4 penalty on saves against poison, and poisons affecting the target continue for another 2 frequency increments (for example, black adder venom lasts 8 rounds instead of 6, and arsenic lasts for 6 minutes instead of 4). Attempts to cure the poisoned target with skill or magic take a -4 penalty.</p>
Phantasmal Killer	Phantasmal Killer	illusion (phantasm) [fear, mind-affecting]	sorcerer/wizard 4	1 standard action	V, S	medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	one living creature	instantaneous	Will disbelief, then Fortitude partial; see text	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You create a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to the subject simply by forming the fears of the subject's subconscious mind into something that its conscious mind can visualize: this most horrible beast. Only the spell's subject can see the <i>phantasmal killer</i>. You see only a vague shape. The target first gets a Will save to recognize the image as unreal. If that save fails, the phantasm touches the subject, and the subject must succeed on a Fortitude save or die from fear. Even if the Fortitude save is successful, the subject takes 3d6 points of damage.</p><p>If the subject of a <i>phantasmal killer </i>attack succeeds in disbelieving and possesses telepathy or is wearing a <i>helm of telepathy, </i>the beast can be turned upon you. You must then disbelieve it or become subject to its deadly fear attack.</p>
Phantom Steed	Phantom Steed	conjuration (creation)	bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3	10 minutes	V, S	0 ft.	one quasi-real, horselike creature	1 hour/level (D)	none	no	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You conjure a Large, quasi-real, horselike creature (the exact coloration can be customized as you wish).

It does not fight, but animals shun it and refuse to attack it.</p><p>The mount is AC 18 (-1 size, +4 natural armor, +5 Dex) and 7 hit points + 1 hit point per caster level. If it loses all its hit points, the phantom steed disappears. A phantom steed has a speed of 20 feet per two caster levels, to a maximum of 100 feet at 10th level. It can bear its rider's weight plus up to 10 pounds per caster level.</p><p>These mounts gain certain powers according to caster level. A mount's abilities include those of mounts of lower caster levels. </p><p><i>8th Level</i>: The mount can ride over sandy, muddy, or even swampy ground without difficulty or decrease in speed.</p><p><i>10th Level</i>: The mount can use <i>water walk </i>at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability).</p><p><i>12th Level</i>: The mount can use <i>air walk </i>at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability) for up to 1 round at a time, after which it falls to the ground.</p><p><i>14th Level</i>: The mount can fly at its speed with a bonus on Fly skill checks equal to your caster level.</p>
Pillar of Life	Pillar of Life	conjuration (healing) [light]	cleric 5	1 standard action	V, S, DF	medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	5-ft.-square pillar of positive energy, 20 ft. high	1 round/level	none	no	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You conjure a pillar of positive energy in a single 5-foot square within range that radiates light as if it were a sunrod. Living creatures adjacent to the pillar can spend a standard action to touch the pillar and heal 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20). Creatures can move into the square containing the pillar, but if an undead creature moves into the pillar it takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6).

If several willing persons link hands in a circle, as many as eight can be affected by the <i>plane shift </i>at the same time. Precise accuracy as to a particular arrival location on the intended plane is nigh impossible. From the Material Plane, you can reach any other plane, though you appear 5 to 500 miles (5d%) from your intended destination. <i>Plane shift </i>transports creatures instantaneously and then ends. The creatures need to find other means if they are to travel back (including casting <i>plane shift</i> again).</p>
Polar Ray	Polar Ray	evocation [cold]	sorcerer/wizard 8	1 standard action	V, S, F (a white ceramic cone or prism)	medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	ray	instantaneous	none	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>A blue-white ray of freezing air and ice springs from your hand.

Prismatic Sphere	Prismatic Sphere	abjuration	sorcerer/wizard 9	1 standard action	V	10 ft.	10-ft.-radius sphere centered on you	10 min./level (D)	see text	see text	<h>Normal Use</h><p>This spell functions like <i>prismatic wall, </i>except you conjure up an immobile, opaque globe of shimmering, multicolored light that surrounds you and protects you from all forms of attack. The sphere flashes in all colors of the visible spectrum. </p><p>The sphere's <i>blindness </i>effect on creatures with less than 8 HD lasts 2d4 ? 10 minutes.</p><p>You can pass into and out of the <i>prismatic sphere </i>and remain near it without harm. When you're inside it, however, the sphere blocks any attempt to project something through the sphere (including spells). Other creatures that attempt to attack you or pass through suffer the effects of each color, one at a time.</p><p>Typically, only the upper hemisphere of the globe exists, since you are at the center of the sphere, so the lower half is usually occluded by the floor surface you are standing on.</p><p>The colors of the sphere have the same effects as the colors of a <i>prismatic wall.</i></p><p><i>Prismatic sphere </i>can be made permanent with a <i>permanency </i>spell.</p><h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>When you cast the spell, you simultaneously create a <i>prismatic spray</i> that originates from one point on the sphere and radiates directly away from you.

The subject gains damage reduction 10/magic against ranged weapons. This spell doesn't grant you the ability to damage creatures with similar damage reduction. Once the spell has prevented a total of 10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 100 points), it is discharged.</p>
Protection from Chaos	Protection from Evil	abjuration [lawful]	cleric 1, paladin 1, sorcerer/wizard 1	1 standard action	V, S, M/DF	touch	creature touched	1 min./level (D)	Will negates (harmless)	no; see text	<h>Normal Use</h><p>This spell functions like <i>protection from evil</i>, except that the deflection and resistance bonuses apply to attacks made by chaotic creatures. The target receives a new saving throw against control by chaotic creatures and chaotic summoned creatures cannot touch the target.</p>
Protection from Evil	Protection from Evil	abjuration [good]	cleric 1, paladin 1, sorcerer/wizard 1	1 standard action	V, S, M/DF	touch	creature touched	1 min./level (D)	Will negates (harmless)	no; see text	<h>Normal Use</h><p>This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from mental control, and from summoned creatures. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.</p><p>First, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures.</p><p>Second, the subject immediately receives another saving throw (if one was allowed to begin with) against any spells or effects that possess or exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment [charm] effects and enchantment [compulsion] effects, such as <i>charm person</i>, <i>command</i>, and <i>dominate person</i>. This saving throw is made with a +2 morale bonus, using the same DC as the original effect. If successful, such effects are suppressed for the duration of this spell. The effects resume when the duration of this spell expires. While under the effects of this spell, the target is immune to any new attempts to possess or exercise mental control over the target. This spell does not expel a controlling life force (such as a ghost or spellcaster using <i>magic</i> <i>jar</i>), but it does prevent them from controlling the target. This second effect only functions against spells and effects created by evil creatures or objects, subject to GM discretion.</p><p>Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by evil summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Summoned creatures that are not evil are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.</p>

You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to strike a target. The subject takes a penalty to Strength equal to 1d6+1 per two caster levels (maximum 1d6+5). The subject's Strength score cannot drop below 1. A successful Fortitude save reduces this penalty by half. This penalty does not stack with itself. Apply the highest penalty instead.</p>

This decrease changes the creature's size category to the next smaller one. The target gains a +2 size bonus to Dexterity, a -2 size penalty to Strength (to a minimum of 1), and a +1 bonus on attack rolls and AC due to its reduced size.</p><p>A Small humanoid creature whose size decreases to Tiny has a space of 2-1/2 feet and a natural reach of 0 feet (meaning that it must enter an opponent's square to attack). A Large humanoid creature whose size decreases to Medium has a space of 5 feet and a natural reach of 5 feet. This spell doesn't change the target's speed.</p><p>All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly reduced by the spell.</p><p>Melee and projectile weapons deal less damage. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any <i>reduced </i>item that leaves the <i>reduced </i>creature's possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size.

Regenerate	Regenerate	conjuration (healing)	cleric 7, druid 9	3 full rounds	V, S, DF	touch	living creature touched	instantaneous	Fortitude negates (harmless)	yes (harmless)	<h>Normal Use</h><p>The subject's severed body members (fingers, toes, hands, feet, arms, legs, tails, or even heads of multiheaded creatures), broken bones, and ruined organs grow back. After the spell is cast, the physical regeneration is complete in 1 round if the severed members are present and touching the creature. It takes 2d10 rounds otherwise.</p><p><i>Regenerate </i>also cures 4d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +35), rids the subject of exhaustion and fatigue, and eliminates all nonlethal damage the subject has taken. It has no effect on nonliving creatures (including undead).</p>
Repel Wood	Repel Wood	transmutation	druid 6	1 standard action	V, S	60 ft.	60-ft. line-shaped emanation from you	1 min./level (D)	none	no	<h>Normal Use</h><p>Waves of energy roll forth from you, moving in the direction that you determine, causing all wooden objects in the path of the spell to be pushed away from you to the limit of the range. Wooden objects larger than 3 inches in diameter that are fixed firmly are not affected, but loose objects are. Objects 3 inches in diameter or smaller that are fixed in place splinter and break, and the pieces move with the wave of energy. Objects affected by the spell are repelled at the rate of 40 feet per round.</p><p>Objects such as wooden shields, spears, wooden weapon shafts and hafts, and arrows and bolts are pushed back, dragging those carrying them along. A creature being dragged by an item it is carrying can let go. A creature being dragged by a shield can loose it as a move action and drop it as a free action. If a spear is planted (set) in a way that prevents this forced movement, it splinters. Even magic items with wooden sections are repelled, although an <i>antimagic field </i>blocks the effects.</p><p>The waves of energy continue to sweep down the set path for the spell's duration. After you cast the spell, the path is set, and you can then do other things or go elsewhere without affecting the spell's power.</p>
Resist Energy	Resist Energy	abjuration	cleric 2, druid 2, paladin 2, ranger 1, sorcerer/wizard 2	1 standard action	V, S, DF	touch	creature touched	10 min./level	Fortitude negates (harmless)	yes (harmless)	<h>Normal Use</h><p>This abjuration grants a creature limited protection from damage of whichever one of five energy types you select: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. The subject gains resist energy 10 against the energy type chosen, meaning that each time the creature is subjected to such damage (whether from a natural or magical source), that damage is reduced by 10 points before being applied to the creature's hit points. The value of the energy resistance granted increases to 20 points at 7th level and to a maximum of 30 points at 11th level. The spell protects the recipient's equipment as well.</p><p><i>Resist energy </i>absorbs only damage. The subject could still suffer unfortunate side effects.</p><p><i>Resist energy </i>overlaps (and does not stack with) <i>protection from energy. </i>If a character is warded by <i>protection from energy </i>and <i>resist energy, </i>the <i>protection </i>spell absorbs damage until its power is exhausted.</p>
Resonating Word	Resonating Word	transmutation [sonic]	bard 5, sorcerer/wizard 7	1 standard action	V	medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	one creature	3 rounds	Fortitude partial	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You speak a terrible word of power, setting up potentially lethal vibrations in the chosen target. The target must save once each round on your turn, and the effects grow stronger for each saving throw the creature fails.</p><p>On the first round, the target takes 5d6 points of sonic damage and is staggered for 1 round. A successful save halves the damage and negates the staggered effect.</p><p>On the second round, the target takes 5d6 points of damage and is stunned for 1 round. A successful save halves the damage and negates the stunning effect.</p><p>On the third round, the target takes 10d6 points of damage and is stunned for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful save halves the damage and negates the stunning effect.</p><p>The resonating word has no power after the third round, even if the spell's duration is increased.</p>

If a solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it in the same manner as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, until the spell ends. At the end of the spell duration, affected objects and creatures fall downward.</p><p>Provided it has something to hold onto, a creature caught in the area can attempt a Reflex save to secure itself when the spell strikes. Creatures who can fly or levitate can keep themselves from falling.</p>
Ricochet Shot	Ricochet Shot	evocation	ranger 2, sorcerer/wizard 2	1 standard action	V, S, M (a wishbone)	close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	one projectile weapon	1 round/level or until discharged	Will negates (harmless, object)	yes (harmless, object)	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You imbue a projectile weapon with the ability to ricochet any projectiles that hit one target so that they also hit another. When the wielder ricochets a projectile, she selects a primary target to attack. If she hits the primary target, the projectile ricochets instead of being destroyed. The wielder can then select a secondary target that is within 20 feet of the primary target. She makes an attack roll against the secondary target at the same base attack bonus, but does not gain the benefit from any enhancement bonuses or magic qualities on the projectile. If the shot comes from a firearm, the ricochet targets normal AC rather than touch AC. </p><p>While the spell lasts, the target weapon's wielder can ricochet one projectile per three caster levels you possess, to a maximum of six at caster level 18th. Once the target weapon's wielder ricochets that many shots, the spell is discharged. If the weapon's wielder fails to use all the ricochets before the spell end, those ricochets are wasted.</p>

Once the spell has been cast, you and the target may cast conjuration (healing) spells with a range of touch upon each other so long as you are within close range (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels).

If the save succeeds, the opponent can attack normally and is unaffected by that casting of the spell. If the save fails, the opponent can't follow through with the attack, that part of its action is lost, and it can't directly attack the warded creature for the duration of the spell. Those not attempting to attack the subject remain unaffected. This spell does not prevent the warded creature from being attacked or affected by area of effect spells. The subject cannot attack without breaking the spell but may use nonattack spells or otherwise act.</p>
Sands of Time	Sands of Time	necromancy	cleric 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3	1 standard action	V, S	touch	touched creature or object	10 minutes/level or instantaneous (see text)	none	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You temporarily age the target, immediately advancing it to the next age category. The target immediately takes the age penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution for its new age category, but does not gain the bonuses for that category. A creature whose age is unknown is treated as if the spell advances it to middle age. Ageless or immortal creatures are immune to this spell.</p><p>If you cast this on an object, construct, or undead creature, it takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15) as time weathers and corrodes it. This version of the spell has an instantaneous duration. </p>

The target gains the fire subtype. Any creature that begins its turn sharing a space with the target takes 2d6 points of fire damage and must make a Fortitude save (DC 15, + 1 per previous check) or suffer the effects of smoke inhalation .</p><h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The damage dealt increases to 3d6 points of fire damage. This otherwise makes the same changes as <i>mythic gaseous form</i>.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target can shift into or out of <i>scorching ash form</i> as a move action.</p>
Scorching Ray	Scorching Ray	evocation [fire]	sorcerer/wizard 2	1 standard action	V, S	close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	one or more rays	instantaneous	none	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You blast your enemies with a searing beam of fire. You may fire one ray, plus one additional ray for every four levels beyond 3rd (to a maximum of three rays at 11th level). Each ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 4d6 points of fire damage.

Scouring Winds	Scouring Winds	evocation [air, earth]	druid 7, sorcerer/wizard 7, witch 7	1 standard action	V, S	medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	sandstorm in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high	1 round/level (D)	none	yes (see text)	<h>Normal Use</h><p>This spell brings forth a windstorm of stinging sand that blocks all vision. You can move the storm up to 30 feet each round as a move action.</p><p>Any creature in the area takes 3d6 points of piercing damage each round. The area is considered a windstorm (see the wind effects table).</p><p>If a creature with spell resistance successfully resists this spell, it is unaffected by the winds and sand, but still unable to see within the area of the spell.</p>
Searing Light	Searing Light	evocation	cleric 3	1 standard action	V, S	medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	ray	instantaneous	none	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>Focusing divine power like a ray of the sun, you project a blast of light from your open palm. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to strike your target. A creature struck by this ray of light takes 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8). An undead creature takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6), and an undead creature particularly vulnerable to bright light takes 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d8).

Sending	Sending	evocation	cleric 4, sorcerer/wizard 5	10 minutes	V, S, M/DF (fine copper wire)	see text	one creature	1 round; see text	none	no	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You contact a particular creature with which you are familiar and send a short message of 25 words or less to the subject. The subject recognizes you if it knows you. It can answer in like manner immediately. A creature with an Intelligence score as low as 1 can understand the <i>sending, </i>though the subject's ability to react is limited as normal by its Intelligence. Even if the <i>sending </i>is received, the subject is not obligated to act upon it in any manner.</p><p>If the creature in question is not on the same plane of existence as you are, there is a 5% chance that the <i>sending </i>does not arrive. (Local conditions on other planes may worsen this chance considerably.)</p>
Shadow Anchor	Shadow Anchor	illusion (shadow) [shadow]	bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2	1 standard action 	S	touch	creature touched - a shadowy shadow tether 	1 round/level (D); see text	Will negates	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>The target's shadow becomes a flexible tether to its current square. The creature can move up to 5 feet from that square without penalty. Moving farther than 5 feet from the tether point requires the target to make a bull rush combat maneuver check against a CMB of 10 + 1/2 your caster level + your Intelligence modifier (if a witch or wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a bard or sorcerer). The target takes a -1 penalty for every 5 feet of distance between it and its tethered square. Failing this check means the target's move is wasted and it cannot move farther away. If it fails this check by 10 or more, it is pulled 5 feet toward the tether square and is knocked prone. If it beats the check by 10 or more, the spell ends. This spell does not work on creatures that do not cast shadows or reflections. If the target uses a teleportation effect or leaves the current plane, the spell ends.</p><h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Add your tier to the CMD of the shadow tether. A creature attempting to escape the shadow tether using planar travel or teleportation must succeed at a Will saving throw or be shunted to the Plane of Shadow instead of its intended destination, as if it had cast <i>shadow walk</i> (if the target could not reach the Shadow Plane from its current location using <i>shadow walk</i>, this aspect of the spell has no effect).</p>
Shadow Weapon	Shadow Weapon	illusion (shadow) [shadow]	sorcerer/wizard 1, witch 1	1 standard action	V, S	0 ft.	one shadow weapon	1 minute/level	Will disbelief (if interacted with)	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>Drawing upon the Plane of Shadow, you shape a quasi-real masterwork melee weapon of a type you are proficient with. You may use this weapon to make attacks as if it were a real weapon, dealing normal damage for a weapon of its type. The first time you hit a creature with the weapon, it may make a Will save to disbelieve; failure means the weapon deals damage normally, success means it only takes 1 point of damage from the weapon's attacks. The weapon only deals 1 point of damage to objects.</p><p>If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the <i>shadow weapon</i> strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the target may save to disbelieve as normal.</p><p>At 5th level, the weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus. At 10th-level, you may increase the enhancement bonus to +2 or add the <i>frost</i> or <i>keen</i> weapon property. The frost and keen properties have no effect if the target makes its disbelief save.</p><p>The spell ends if the weapon leaves your possession.</p>

They count as mythic creatures for the purpose of path abilities, spells, and other effects that function differently for mythic creatures. This doesn't grant the targets mythic tiers or any uses of mythic power; it merely gives them a greater advantage when others use abilities that work differently for mythic creatures. You must be at least a 1st-tier mythic character to cast this spell.</p>
Shatter	Shatter	evocation [sonic]	bard 2, cleric 2, sorcerer/wizard 2	1 standard action	V, S, M/DF (a chip of mica)	close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	5-ft.-radius spread; or one solid object or one crystalline creature	instantaneous	Will negates (object); Will negates (object) or Fortitude half; see text	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p><i>Shatter </i>creates a loud, ringing noise that breaks brittle, nonmagical objects; sunders a single solid, nonmagical object; or damages a crystalline creature.</p><p>Used as an area attack, <i>shatter </i>destroys nonmagical objects of crystal, glass, ceramic, or porcelain. All such unattended objects within a 5-foot radius of the point of origin are smashed into dozens of pieces by the spell. Objects weighing more than 1 pound per your level are not affected, but all other objects of the appropriate composition are shattered.</p><p>Alternatively, you can target <i>shatter </i>against a single solid nonmagical object, regardless of composition, weighing up to 10 pounds per caster level. Targeted against a crystalline creature (of any weight), <i>shatter </i>deals 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 10d6), with a Fortitude save for half damage.</p>

The subject gains a +1 deflection bonus to AC and a +1 resistance bonus on saves. Additionally, the subject takes only half damage from all wounds and attacks (including those dealt by special abilities) that deal hit point damage. The amount of damage not taken by the warded creature is taken by you. Forms of harm that do not involve hit points, such as <i>charm </i>effects, temporary ability damage, level draining, and death effects, are not affected. If the subject suffers a reduction of hit points from a lowered Constitution score, the reduction is not split with you because it is not hit point damage. When the spell ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided between the subject and you, but damage already split is not reassigned to the subject.</p><p>If you and the subject of the spell move out of range of each other, the spell ends.</p>
Shocking Grasp	Shocking Grasp	evocation [electricity]	sorcerer/wizard 1	1 standard action	V, S	touch	creature or object touched	instantaneous	none	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>Your successful melee touch attack deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 5d6).

Shout	Shout	evocation [sonic]	bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 4	1 standard action	V	30 ft.	cone-shaped burst	instantaneous	Fortitude partial or Reflex negates (object); see text	yes (object)	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You emit an ear-splitting yell that deafens and damages creatures in its path. Any creature within the area is deafened for 2d6 rounds and takes 5d6 points of sonic damage. A successful save negates the deafness and reduces the damage by half. Any exposed brittle or crystalline object or crystalline creature takes 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). An affected creature is allowed a Fortitude save to reduce the damage by half, and a creature holding fragile objects can negate damage to them with a successful Reflex save. A <i>shout </i>spell cannot penetrate a <i>silence </i>spell.</p>
Silence	Silence	illusion (glamer)	bard 2, cleric 2	1 round	V, S	long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)	20-ft.-radius emanation centered on a creature, object, or point in space	1 round/level (D)	Will negates; see text or none (object)	yes; see text or no (object)	<h>Normal Use</h><p>Upon the casting of this spell, complete silence prevails in the affected area. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible, spells with verbal components cannot be cast, and no noise whatsoever issues from, enters, or passes through the area. The spell can be cast on a point in space, but the effect is stationary unless cast on a mobile object. The spell can be centered on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature can attempt a Will save to negate the spell and can use spell resistance, if any. Items in a creature's possession or magic items that emit sound receive the benefits of saves and spell resistance, but unattended objects and points in space do not. Creatures in an area of a <i>silence </i>spell are immune to sonic or language-based attacks, spells, and effects.</p>
Silent Image	Silent Image	illusion (figment)	bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1	1 standard action	V, S, F (a bit of fleece)	long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)	visual figment that cannot extend beyond four 10-ft. cubes + one 10-ft. cube/level (S)	concentration	Will disbelief (if interacted with)	no	<h>Normal Use</h><p>This spell creates the visual illusion of an object, creature, or force, as visualized by you.

Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. HD that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature is a standard action (an application of the aid another action). <i>Sleep </i>does not target unconscious creatures, constructs, or undead creatures.</p>
Slow	Slow	transmutation	bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3	1 standard action	V, S, M (a drop of molasses)	close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart	1 round/level	Will negates	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>An affected creature moves and attacks at a drastically slowed rate. Creatures affected by this spell are staggered and can take only a single move action or standard action each turn, but not both (nor may it take full-round actions). Additionally, it takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves. A <i>slowed </i>creature moves at half its normal speed (round down to the next 5-foot increment), which affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for decreased speed.</p><p>Multiple <i>slow </i>effects don't stack. <i>Slow </i>counters and dispels <i>haste</i>.</p>
Solid Fog	Solid Fog	conjuration (creation)	sorcerer/wizard 4	1 standard action	V, S, M (powdered peas and an animal hoof)	medium (100 ft. + 10 ft. level)	fog spreads in 20-ft. radius	1 min./level	none	no	<h>Normal Use</h><p>This spell functions like <i>fog cloud</i>, but in addition to obscuring sight, the <i>solid fog</i> is so thick that it impedes movement. Creatures moving through a <i>solid fog</i> move at half their normal speed and take a -2 penalty on all melee attack and melee damage rolls. The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like). A creature or object that falls into <i>solid fog</i> is slowed so that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes through reduces the falling damage by 1d6. A creature cannot take a 5-foot-step while in <i>solid fog</i>. <i>Solid fog</i>, and effects that work like <i>solid fog</i>, do not stack with each other in terms of slowed movement and attack penalties.</p><p>Unlike normal fog, only a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these vapors, and it does so in 1 round.</p><p><i>Solid fog </i>can be made permanent with a <i>permanency </i>spell.

The affected creature must have its hands free to climb in this manner. The subject gains a climb speed of 20 feet and a +8 racial bonus on Climb skill checks; furthermore, it need not make Climb checks to traverse a vertical or horizontal surface (even upside down). A <i>spider climbing </i>creature retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus to their attacks against it. It cannot, however, use the run action while climbing.</p>

Any creature moving on foot into or through the spell's area moves at half speed. In addition, each creature moving through the area takes 1d8 points of piercing damage for each 5 feet of movement through the spiked area.</p><p>Any creature that takes damage from this spell must also succeed on a Reflex save to avoid injuries to its feet and legs. A failed save causes the creature's speed to be reduced to half normal for 24 hours or until the injured creature receives a <i>cure </i>spell (which also restores lost hit points). Another character can remove the penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the injuries and succeeding on a Heal check against the spell's save DC.</p><p>Magic traps such as <i>spike stones </i>are hard to detect. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find <i>spike stones</i>. The DC is 25 + spell level, or DC 29 for <i>spike stones</i>.<i> Spike stones </i>is a magic trap that can't be disabled with the Disable Device skill.</p>
Spiritual Weapon	Spiritual Weapon	evocation [force]	cleric 2	1 standard action	V, S, DF	medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	magic weapon of force	1 round/level (D)	none	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>A weapon made of force appears and attacks foes at a distance, as you direct it, dealing 1d8 force damage per hit, + 1 point per three caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you (see below) and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the reduction in damage associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats or combat actions do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers.</p><p>Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round's target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to. Even if the <i>spiritual weapon </i>is a ranged weapon, use the spell's range, not the weapon's normal range increment, and switching targets still is a move action.</p><p>A <i>spiritual weapon </i>cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>disintegrate</i>, a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>, or a <i>rod of cancellation </i>affects it. A <i>spiritual weapon</i>'s AC against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object).</p><p>If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the <i>spiritual weapon </i>strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.</p><p>The weapon that you get is often a force replica of your deity's own personal weapon. A cleric without a deity gets a weapon based on his alignment. A neutral cleric without a deity can create a <i>spiritual weapon </i>of any alignment, provided he is acting at least generally in accord with that alignment at the time. The weapons associated with each alignment are as follows: chaos (battleaxe), evil (light flail), good (warhammer), law (longsword).</p>

Living creatures in the cloud become nauseated. This condition lasts as long as the creature is in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after it leaves. (Roll separately for each nauseated character.) Any creature that succeeds on its save but remains in the cloud must continue to save each round on your turn. This is a poison effect.</p><p><i>Stinking cloud </i>can be made permanent with a <i>permanency </i>spell. A permanent <i>stinking cloud </i>dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.</p>

The subject gains DR 10/adamantine. It ignores the first 10 points of damage each time it takes damage from a weapon, though an adamantine weapon bypasses the reduction. Once the spell has prevented a total of 10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 150 points), it is discharged.</p>
Storm of Vengeance	Storm of Vengeance	conjuration (summoning)	cleric 9, druid 9	1 round	V, S	long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)	360-ft.-radius storm cloud	concentration (maximum 10 rounds) (D)	see text	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You create a huge black storm cloud in the air. Each creature under the cloud must succeed on a Fortitude save or be deafened for 1d4 x 10 minutes. Each round you continue to concentrate, the spell generates additional effects as noted below. Each effect occurs on your turn.</p><p><i>2nd Round</i>: Acid rains down in the area, dealing 1d6 points of acid damage (no save).</p><p><i>3rd Round</i>: You call six bolts of lightning down from the cloud.

Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). Speed is reduced by three-quarters.</p><p>Ranged attacks within the area of the storm are impossible. Spells cast within the area are disrupted unless the caster succeeds on a Concentration check against a DC equal to the <i>storm of vengeance</i>'s save DC + the level of the spell the caster is trying to cast.</p>
Strangling Hair	Strangling Hair	transmutation	sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3	1 standard action	V, S	close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	one creature	concentration, up to 1 round/level	none	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>Your hair animates and extends to grapple and constrict an opponent. Make a grapple check against the target using your caster level as the base attack bonus plus a bonus equal to your Intelligence bonus (if a witch or wizard) or Charisma bonus (if a sorcerer). This grapple check does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If your hair succeeds in grappling a foe, that creature takes 1d6 points of damage or your unarmed strike damage, whichever is greater, and gains the grappled condition. Your hair receives a +5 bonus on grapple checks made against opponents it is already grappling, but cannot move foes or pin foes. Each round that your hair succeeds on a grapple check, it deals an additional 1d6 points of damage. The CMD of your hair, for the purposes of escaping the grapple, is equal to 10 + its CMB.</p><p>Once you choose a target, your hair continues to attack that target independently of your own actions. You may designate a new target as a move action, which causes your hair to release its current target (if any) and attack the new target that round. Your hair cannot be targeted as a separate creature, but it can be dispelled.</p>
Suggestion	Suggestion	enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependent, mind-affecting]	bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 3	1 standard action	V, M (a snake's tongue and a honeycomb)	close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	one living creature	1 hour/level or until completed	Will negates	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You influence the actions of the target creature by suggesting a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two). The <i>suggestion </i>must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Asking the creature to do some obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell. </p><p>The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. You can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. If the condition is not met before the spell duration expires, the activity is not performed.</p><p>A very reasonable <i>suggestion </i>causes the save to be made with a penalty (such as -1 or -2).</p>

(You may summon the swarm so that it shares the area of other creatures.) If no living creatures are within its area, the swarm attacks or pursues the nearest creature as best it can. The caster has no control over its target or direction of travel.</p>
Sun Metal	Sun Metal	transmutation [fire]	cleric 1, paladin 1, ranger 1	1 standard action	V, S	touch	one melee weapon	1 round/level (see text)	Fortitude negates (object)	yes (object)	<h>Normal Use</h><p>The target weapon ignites into flame that does not hurt the weapon or the wielder, but damages those hit by the weapon. When the weapon's wielder hits with this weapon, it deals an additional 1d4 points of fire damage. This damage is not multiplied in the case of a critical hit. This effect immediately ends if the weapon is submerged in water. This effect does not stack with the <i>flaming</i> or <i>flaming burst</i> weapon special ability or any other effect that grants the weapon extra fire damage. It does not function on weapons with the <i>frost</i> or <i>icy burst</i> weapon special ability or any other effect that grants a weapon extra cold damage.</p>
Sunbeam	Sunbeam	evocation [light]	druid 7	1 standard action	V, S, DF	60 ft.	line from your hand	1 round/level or until all beams are exhausted	Reflex negates and Reflex half; see text	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>For the duration of this spell, you can use a standard action to evoke a dazzling beam of intense light each round. You can call forth one beam per three caster levels (maximum six beams at 18th level). The spell ends when its duration runs out or your allotment of beams is exhausted.</p><p>Each creature in the beam is blinded and takes 4d6 points of damage. Any creatures to which sunlight is harmful or unnatural take double damage. A successful Reflex save negates the blindness and reduces the damage by half.</p><p>An undead creature caught within the beam takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6), or half damage if a Reflex save is successful. In addition, the beam results in the destruction of any undead creature specifically harmed by bright light if it fails its save.</p><p>The ultraviolet light generated by the spell deals damage to fungi, mold, oozes, and slimes just as if they were undead creatures.</p>
Surmount Affliction	Surmount Affliction	abjuration	cleric 2, inquisitor 2	1 standard action	V, S	you	personal	1 round/level	none	none	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You temporarily overcome one harmful condition. This does not end the effect causing the condition; it just suspends that condition's effect for the duration of the spell. You can surmount any one of the following conditions: blinded, confused, dazed, dazzled, deafened, fatigued, frightened, paralyzed, shaken, or sickened.</p><h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>You can cast this spell with no verbal or somatic component, and even if you're helpless (but not unconscious). You temporarily overcome a number of additional harmful conditions equal to half your tier.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (7th)</h>: If you expend three uses of mythic power, you become immune to all afflictions the spell can normally overcome. In addition, you overcome (but do not become immune to) one of the following conditions: exhausted, nauseated, panicked, petrified, staggered, and stunned.</p>
Telekinesis	Telekinesis	transmutation	sorcerer/wizard 5	1 standard action	V, S	long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)	see text	concentration (up to 1 round/level) or instantaneous; see text	Will negates (object) or none; see text	yes (object); see text	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You move objects or creatures by concentrating on them. Depending on the version selected, the spell can provide a gentle, sustained force, perform a variety of combat maneuvers, or exert a single short, violent thrust.</p><p><i>Sustained Force</i>: A sustained force moves an object weighing no more than 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level) up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with spell resistance.</p><p>This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or in both directions. An object cannot be moved beyond your range. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops.</p><p>An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require DC 15 Intelligence checks.</p><p><i>Combat Maneuver</i>: Alternatively, once per round, you can use <i>telekinesis </i>to perform a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don't provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your Combat Maneuver Bonus, and you add your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier. No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration.</p><p><i>Violent Thrust</i>: Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object or creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).</p><p>You must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects). Objects and creatures that miss their target land in a square adjacent to the target.</p><p>Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell.</p><p>If a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).</p>
Terraform	Terraform	transmutation	cleric 7, druid 6, sorcerer/wizard 7, witch 7	1 hour	V, S, M (10,000 gp worth of precious minerals, see text)	100 feet	100-foot-radius emanation, centered on you	1 day/level (see text)	none	no	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You alter the area's terrain and climate to a new terrain and climate type appropriate to the planet or plane. For example, you might transform a desert to plains. To cast this spell, you must expend 10 uses of mythic power along with the material cost. This magically alters the area's climate and normal plants to those appropriate to the new terrain, but doesn't affect creatures or the configuration of the earth. Transforming rocky hills into forested areas converts grasses into shrubs and small trees, but doesn't flatten the hills or change the animals to suit the new environment.</p><p>You can alter the climate by one step (warm, temperate, or cold). The maximum extent of the terrain change is up to the GM, but in general is to a similar terrain type or one step within that terrain type (such as from a typical forest to a forest with massive trees or light undergrowth, from a shallow bog to a deep bog, and so on). You might be able to shift the land to a similar terrain type, such as turning a sparse forest into a relatively dry swamp. Local creatures adversely affected by these alterations either flee the area or quickly die, depending on their mobility and awareness of the change.</p><p>Multiple castings of the spell in the same area can create an area with radically different terrain and climate than the surrounding land. The GM can decide that certain terrain shifts are unsustainable and shorten the duration, or that some are suitable for the area and extend the duration.</p><p>This spell could have many secondary effects based on the nature of the change, the type of bordering terrain, and so on; these should be determined by the GM on a case-by-case basis. For example, transforming a desert requires drawing water up from underground to sustain the plants, which could deplete the water table in nearby areas. Creating a warm desert in the middle of a snowy tundra will create a bordering area of mud and frequent storms from the clash of hot and cold air fronts.</p><p>If you're at least 8th tier, you can expend 20 uses of mythic power instead of 10 to increase the range to 1 mile, the area to a 1-mile-radius emanation centered on you, and the duration to 1 month per caster level.</p>
Theft Ward	Theft Ward	abjuration	cleric 1, inquisitor 1, sorcerer/wizard 1, witch 1	1 standard action 	V, S	touch	one object	1 day	Will negates (harmless, object)	yes (harmless, object)	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You ward a single object in your possession against theft. You gain a +10 bonus on Perception checks to notice someone trying to take the object from you.</p><h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Add your tier to the Perception check bonus. Add your tier to your CMD against disarm and steal combat maneuvers attempted against the item.</p>
Time Stop	Time Stop	transmutation	sorcerer/wizard 9	1 standard action	V	personal	you	1d4+1 rounds (apparent time); see text	none	none	<h>Normal Use</h><p>This spell seems to make time cease to flow for everyone but you. In fact, you speed up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen, though they are actually still moving at their normal speeds. You are free to act for 1d4+1 rounds of apparent time. Normal and magical fire, cold, gas, and the like can still harm you. While the <i>time stop </i>is in effect, other creatures are invulnerable to your attacks and spells; you cannot target such creatures with any attack or spell. A spell that affects an area and has a duration longer than the remaining duration of the <i>time stop</i> have their normal effects on other creatures once the <i>time stop </i>ends. Most spellcasters use the additional time to improve their defenses, summon allies, or flee from combat.</p><p>You cannot move or harm items held, carried, or worn by a creature stuck in normal time, but you can affect any item that is not in another creature's possession.</p><p>You are undetectable while <i>time stop </i>lasts. You cannot enter an area protected by an <i>antimagic field </i>while under the effect of <i>time stop.</i></p><h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Select a number of creatures equal to half your tier or fewer within close range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels). <i>Mythic time stop</i> has the same effect on these creatures as it does on you, allowing them to act for the same number of rounds of apparent time that you can. You and these creatures can all interact with one another normally while time appears to be stopped.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (10th)</h>: If you expend three uses of mythic power, the duration increases to 1 hour per level of apparent time. You and other affected creatures gain no benefit from rest or sleep while the spell is active.</p>
Touch Injection	Touch Injection	transmutation	alchemist 2, sorcerer/wizard 3	1 standard action	V, S	personal	you	1 hour/level	none	no	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You must hold an elixir, infused extract, poison, or potion in hand as you cast this spell. The held substance drains from its container into a magical sac in your body. While the spell lasts, you can deliver the substance with a mere touch. To do so to an opponent, you must make a successful melee touch attack. If you hit, the substance takes effect immediately, despite any onset period, and that opponent receives the normal saving throw (if any) against the substance. In the case of a personal infused extract, the opponent receives both a Fortitude save and spell resistance. If you miss, the substance remains in the magical sac for you to use later.</p><p>This spell protects you from poison in the sac, but unless you have the poison use class feature, you suffer a 5% chance of exposing yourself to the poison when you first cast the spell. If you roll a natural 1 while attempting to inject the poison into an enemy, you are exposed to it.</p>
Transformation	Transformation	transmutation	sorcerer/wizard 6	1 standard action	V, S, M (a potion of bull's strength, which you drink and whose effects are subsumed by the spell effects)	personal	you	1 round/level	none	none	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You become a fighting machine--stronger, tougher, faster, and more skilled in combat. Your mindset changes so that you relish combat and you can't cast spells, even from magic items.</p><p>You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, a +4 natural armor bonus to AC, a +5 competence bonus on Fortitude saves, and proficiency with all simple and martial weapons. Your base attack bonus equals your character level (which may give you multiple attacks).</p><p>You lose your spellcasting ability, including your ability to use spell activation or spell completion magic items, just as if the spells were no longer on your class list.</p><h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>You can still cast spells and use spell completion and spell trigger items, but the level of the spell you're casting or using must be equal to or less than your tier. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your caster level.</p>
True Form	True Form	abjuration	druid 4, sorcerer/wizard 4	1 standard action	V, S	medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	up to one creature/3 levels, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart	1 round/level	Will negates	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p><i>True form</i> removes any polymorph effect from a target creature, returning it to its true form, even against its will. Against creatures affected by polymorph spell effects (such as <i>baleful polymorph</i> or <i>giant form</i>), you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect. Success means that the polymorph effect immediately ends.</p><p>A creature with the supernatural ability to change shape (such as a lycanthrope) must make a Will saving throw or immediately revert to its true form. If it fails this first saving throw, the creature can attempt another Will saving throw to overcome the spell as a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If this save succeeds, the spell ends and the creature is capable of changing shape once again. If the second save fails, the creature is locked in its true form for the duration of the spell, preventing any further polymorph effects from changing its shape.</p><h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The spell's target changes to up to one creature per 2 caster levels. If a target is a creature that has the ability to change shape between a specific set of forms (such as a barghest or lycanthrope), you may choose which form the creature takes. To force such a creature into a form, you must have either seen it in that form or succeeded at an appropriate Knowledge check to know the creature has the ability to take that form.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (6th)</h>: If you expend three uses of mythic power, the spell creates an area affecting all shapechanging creatures. The range changes to 30 feet and the spell affects all creatures in a 30-foot radius around you. Each creature must attempt a saving throw against the spell every round it remains in the area.</p>
True Strike	True Strike	divination	sorcerer/wizard 1	1 standard action	V, F (small wooden replica of an archery target)	personal	you	see text	none	none	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You gain temporary, intuitive insight into the immediate future during your next attack. Your next single attack roll (if it is made before the end of the next round) gains a +20 insight bonus. Additionally, you are not affected by the miss chance that applies to attackers trying to strike a concealed target.</p><h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>The affected attack bypasses all damage reduction.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (2nd)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you gain a +10 insight bonus on your second attack that round and a +5 insight bonus on your third attack that round. The second and third attacks can be on your turn or on another creature's turn before your next turn (such as when you attempt an attack of opportunity).</p>
Tsunami	Tsunami	conjuration (creation) [water]	druid 9, sorcerer/wizard 9	1 standard action	V, S	long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)	10-ft.-deep wave 10 ft. wide/level and 2 ft. tall/level	5 rounds	see text	no	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You create a massive wave of water that then moves in a straight line across water or land--;you select the direction the wave travels (which must be perpendicular to its width), but once set in motion, the wave cannot change course. Over the surface of open water, the wave travels at a speed of 60 feet per round--;on land or underwater, the wave travels at a speed of 30 feet per round.</p><p>Creatures struck by a tsunami take 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (a Fortitude save halves this damage). In addition, the tsunami makes a special CMB check against any creature it strikes--;the wave's CMB is equal to your caster level + your relevant spellcasting ability score modifier (whichever is highest) + 8 (for the wave's size). If this CMB check defeats a creature's CMD, the creature is knocked prone and carried along by the wave. A creature carried along by a tsunami can attempt to escape the wave on its turn as a standard action by making a CMB or Swim check opposed by the wave's CMB check--;if a creature fails to escape, it takes another 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Fortitude save for half) and continues being carried along by the wave.</p><p>Objects struck by a tsunami are swept up if they are Huge or smaller and are carried along by the wave, deposited in a pile at the end of the wave's journey. Gargantuan or larger objects, as well as structures or objects firmly attached to the ground, take 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage when a tsunami passes through its space--;if this is enough to destroy the object or structure, the remains are carried along by the wave. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. <i>Freedom of movement</i> prevents a creature from being carried along by a tsunami but does not prevent damage caused by it hitting a creature.</p><p>A solid barrier that is taller than the tsunami that is not destroyed by the wave stops that portion of the wave from continuing onward, leaving a gap in the wave as the rest of it continues forward.</p>
Unholy Blight	Unholy Blight	evocation [evil]	cleric 4	1 standard action	V, S	medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	20-ft.-radius spread	instantaneous (1d4 rounds); see text	Will partial	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You call up unholy power to smite your enemies. The power takes the form of a cold, cloying miasma of greasy darkness. Only good and neutral (not evil) creatures are harmed by the spell.</p><p>The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to a good creature (or 1d6 per caster level, maximum 10d6, to a good outsider) and causes it to be sickened for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will save reduces damage to half and negates the sickened effect. The effects cannot be negated by <i>remove disease </i>or <i>heal, </i>but <i>remove curse </i>is effective.</p><p>The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither evil nor good, and they are not sickened. Such a creature can reduce the damage by half again (down to one-quarter) with a successful Will save.</p>
Unshakable Chill	Unshakable Chill	necromancy [cold]	druid 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2	1 standard action	V, S, M	close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	one creature	10 minutes/level; see text	Fortitude negates (see text)	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>The target is filled with an unshakable chill for the duration of the spell, and suffers from the effects of severe cold (<i>Core Rulebook</i> 442). Severe cold means if the initial saving throw fails, the target takes 1d6 points of nonlethal cold damage and must save every 10 minutes (using the DC of severe cold instead of this spell's DC) or take additional damage.</p>
Vampiric Touch	Vampiric touch	necromancy	sorcerer/wizard 3	1 standard action	V, S	touch	living creature touched	instantaneous/1 hour; see text	none	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You must succeed on a melee touch attack. Your touch deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d6). You gain temporary hit points equal to the damage you deal. You can't gain more than the subject's current hit points + the subject's Constitution score (which is enough to kill the subject). The temporary hit points disappear 1 hour later.</p>
Vomit Twin	Vomit Twin	conjuration (creation, teleportation)	alchemist 3, magus 3, sorcerer/wizard 4, summoner 3	1 standard action	V, S	personal	creates one ooze duplicate of the caster	1 round/level	none	none	<h>Normal Use</h><p>Upon casting this spell, you vomit forth a disgusting ooze copy of yourself into a single adjacent square. As long as the twin exists, whenever you take a move action to move, the twin can move as well, although it does not need to follow you and cannot take any other actions. On subsequent rounds, at the start of your turn, you can instantaneously exchange places with your twin, as if using <i>teleport</i>. This is not an action and does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p><p>The twin has a speed of 30 feet and provokes attacks of opportunity from movement as normal. It has an AC equal to 10 + 1/2 your caster level and a number of hit points equal to your caster level. If the twin is reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed, although you can create a new one on your turn as a standard action as long as the duration persists. You cannot have more than one vomit twin at a time.</p><h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>Any spell you cast that has a range of touch, close, medium, or long can originate from the twin instead of you. The twin gains a deflection bonus to AC equal to your tier, and has hit points equal to double your caster level. The twin can attempt attacks of opportunity using your base attack bonus, but has no ability score modifiers, skills, or feats. It threatens an area appropriate for your size and wields a copy of the weapon you were wielding when you cast <i>mythic vomit twin</i>. If the twin's weapon is destroyed or disarmed, on your turn the twin generates a new weapon from its own substance. Its attacks deal damage using that weapon's die type.</p><p><h>Mythic Augmented (5th)</h>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you create two copies when you cast the spell, and both can be active at the same time. If you instead expend three uses of mythic power, you create three copies when you cast the spell, and all three can be active at the same time.</p>
Walk through Space	Walk through Space	conjuration (teleportation)	alchemist 6, magus 6, sorcerer/wizard 7, summoner 6, witch 7	1 standard action	V, S, M (a wren's egg)	personal	you	1 round/level	none	none	<h>Normal Use</h><p>When under the effects of this spell, you can teleport up to 30 feet as a move action. You must end this movement in an unoccupied space that you can stand on within line of sight. Alternatively, you can spend a move action to teleport to a standing position from lying prone. Teleporting does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p><h>Mythic Enhanced</h><p>You can teleport as either a move action or a swift action, but never more than once per round. If you expend a move action and a swift action, you may teleport up to 60 feet.</p>
Wall of Fire	Wall of Fire	evocation [fire]	druid 5, sorcerer/wizard 4	1 standard action	V, S, M/DF (a piece of phosphor)	medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	opaque sheet of flame up to 20 ft. long/level or a ring of fire with a radius of up to 5 ft./two levels; either form 20 ft. high	concentration + 1 round/level	none	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>An immobile, blazing curtain of shimmering violet fire springs into existence. One side of the wall, selected by you, sends forth waves of heat, dealing 2d4 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of fire damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears, and to all creatures in the area on your turn each round. In addition, the wall deals 2d6 points of fire damage + 1 point of fire damage per caster level (maximum +20) to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double damage to undead creatures.</p><p>If you evoke the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. If any 5-foot length of wall takes 20 points or more of cold damage in 1 round, that length goes away. (Do not divide cold damage by 2, as normal for objects.)</p><p><i>Wall of fire </i>can be made permanent with a <i>permanency </i>spell. A permanent <i>wall of fire </i>that is extinguished by cold damage becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then reforms at normal strength.</p>
Wall of Force	Wall of Force	evocation [force]	sorcerer/wizard 5	1 standard action	V, S, M (powdered quartz)	close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	wall whose area is up to one 10-ft. square/level	1 round /level (D)	none	no	<h>Normal Use</h><p>A <i>wall of force</i> creates an invisible wall of pure force. The wall cannot move and is not easily destroyed. A <i>wall of force</i> is immune to <i>dispel magic, </i>although a <i>mage's disjunction</i> can still dispel it<i>. </i>A<i> wall of force </i>can be damaged by spells as normal, except for<i> disintegrate,</i> which automatically destroys it. It can be damaged by weapons and supernatural abilities, but a <i>wall of force</i> has hardness 30 and a number of hit points equal to 20 per caster level. Contact with a <i>sphere of annihilation </i>or <i>rod of cancellation</i> instantly destroys a <i>wall of force.</i></p><p>Breath weapons and spells cannot pass through a <i>wall of force</i> in either direction, although <i>dimension door</i>, <i>teleport</i>, and similar effects can bypass the barrier. It blocks ethereal creatures as well as material ones (though ethereal creatures can usually circumvent the wall by going around it, through material floors and ceilings). Gaze attacks can operate through a <i>wall of force</i>.</p><p>The caster can form the wall into a flat, vertical plane whose area is up to one 10-foot square per level. The wall must be continuous and unbroken when formed. If its surface is broken by any object or creature, the spell fails.</p><p><i>Wall of force </i>can be made permanent with a <i>permanency </i>spell.</p>
Wall of Ice	Wall of Ice	evocation [cold]	sorcerer/wizard 4	1 standard action	V, S, M (a piece of quartz or rock crystal)	medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	anchored plane of ice, up to one 10-ft. square/level, or hemisphere of ice with a radius of up to 3 ft. + 1 ft./level	1 min./level	Reflex negates; see text	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>This spell creates an anchored plane of ice or a hemisphere of ice, depending on the version selected. A <i>wall of ice </i>cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Any creature adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt a Reflex save to disrupt the wall as it is being formed. A successful save indicates that the spell automatically fails. Fire can melt a <i>wall of ice, </i>and it deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects). Suddenly melting a <i>wall of ice </i>creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes.</p><p><i>Ice Plane</i>: A sheet of strong, hard ice appears. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level. It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th-level wizard can create a <i>wall of ice</i> 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, or any other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,000 square feet). The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides.</p><p>Each 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level.</p><p>Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point per caster level (no save).</p><p><i>Hemisphere</i>: The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet + 1 foot per caster level. The <i>hemisphere </i>is as hard to break through as the <i>ice plane </i>form, but it does not deal damage to those who go through a breach.</p>
Wall of Iron	Wall of Iron	conjuration (creation)	sorcerer/wizard 6	1 standard action	V, S, M (a small iron sheet plus gold dust worth 50 gp)	medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	iron wall whose area is up to one 5-ft. square/level; see text	instantaneous	see text	no	<h>Normal Use</h><p>You cause a flat, vertical iron wall to spring into being. The wall inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. It must always be a flat plane, though you can shape its edges to fit the available space.</p><p>A <i>wall of iron </i>is 1 inch thick per four caster levels. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 25 + 2 per inch of thickness.</p><p>If you desire, the wall can be created vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left unpushed. Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly. A creature must make a DC 40 Strength check to push the wall over. Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful Reflex saves. Any Large or smaller creature that fails takes 10d6 points of damage while fleeing from the wall. The wall cannot crush Huge and larger creatures.</p><p>Like any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation, and other natural phenomena. Iron created by this spell is not suitable for use in the creation of other objects and cannot be sold.</p>
Wall of Stone	Wall of Stone	conjuration (creation) [earth]	cleric 5, druid 6, sorcerer/wizard 5	1 standard action	V, S, M/DF (a small block of granite)	medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	stone wall whose area is up to one 5-ft. square/level (S)	instantaneous	see text	no	<h>Normal Use</h><p>This spell creates a wall of rock that merges into adjoining rock surfaces. A <i>wall of stone </i>is 1 inch thick per four caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.</p><p>Unlike a <i>wall of iron, </i>you can create a <i>wall of stone </i>in almost any shape you desire. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell's area by half. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area.</p><p>Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a <i>disintegrate </i>spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping. Each 5-foot square of the wall has hardness 8 and 15 hit points per inch of thickness. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness.</p><p>It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a <i>wall of stone</i>, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures. Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful Reflex saves.</p>
Wall of Thorns	Wall of Thorns	conjuration (creation)	druid 5	1 standard action	V, S	medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	wall of thorny brush, up to one 10-ft. cube/level (S)	10 min./level (D)	none	no	<h>Normal Use</h><p>A <i>wall of thorns </i>spell creates a barrier of very tough, pliable, tangled brush bearing needle-sharp thorns as long as a human's finger. Any creature forced into or attempting to move through a <i>wall of thorns </i>takes piercing damage per round of movement equal to 25 minus the creature's AC. Dexterity and dodge bonuses to AC do not count for this calculation. (Creatures with an AC of 25 or higher, without considering Dexterity and dodge bonuses, take no damage from contact with the wall.)</p><p>You can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape the wall as a number of 10-by-10-by-5-foot blocks equal to twice your caster level. This has no effect on the damage dealt by the thorns, but any creature attempting to break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier.</p><p>Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a Strength check as a full-round action. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds 20, a creature moves 5 feet (up to a maximum distance equal to its normal land speed). Of course, moving or attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as described above. A creature trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage.</p><p>Any creature within the area of the spell when it is cast takes damage as if it had moved into the wall and is caught inside. In order to escape, it must attempt to push its way free, or it can wait until the spell ends. Creatures with the ability to pass through overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a <i>wall of thorns </i>at normal speed without taking damage.</p><p>A <i>wall of thorns </i>can be breached by slow work with edged weapons. Chopping away at the wall creates a safe passage 1 foot deep for every 10 minutes of work. Normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but magical fire burns it away in 10 minutes.</p>
Web	Web	conjuration (creation)	sorcerer/wizard 2	1 standard action	V, S, M (spider web)	medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	webs in a 20-ft.-radius spread	10 min./level (D)	Reflex negates; see text	no	<h>Normal Use</h><p><i>Web </i>creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands. These strands trap those caught in them. The strands are similar to spiderwebs but far larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears. Creatures caught within a web become grappled by the sticky fibers. Attacking a creature in a web doesn't cause you to become grappled.</p><p>Anyone in the effect's area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is inside the web but is otherwise unaffected. If the save fails, the creature gains the grappled condition, but can break free by making a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check as a standard action against the DC of this spell. The entire area of the web is considered difficult terrain. Anyone moving through the webs must make a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check as part of their move action, with a DC equal to the spell's DC. Creatures that fail lose their movement and become grappled in the first square of webbing that they enter.</p><p>If you have at least 5 feet of web between you and an opponent, it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of web between you, it provides total cover.</p><p>The strands of a <i>web </i>spell are flammable. A <i>flaming weapon </i>can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire can set the webs alight and burn away one 5-foot square in 1 round. All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames.</p><p><i>Web </i>can be made permanent with a <i>permanency </i>spell. A permanent web that is damaged (but not destroyed) regrows in 10 minutes.</p>
Whirlwind	Whirlwind	evocation [air]	druid 8	1 standard action	V, S, DF	long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)	cyclone 10 ft. wide at base, 30 ft. wide at top, and 30 ft. tall	1 round/level (D)	Reflex negates; see text	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>This spell creates a powerful cyclone of raging wind that moves through the air, along the ground, or over water at a speed of 60 feet per round. You can concentrate on controlling the cyclone's every movement or specify a simple program. Directing the cyclone's movement or changing its programmed movement is a standard action for you. The cyclone always moves during your turn. If the cyclone exceeds the spell's range, it moves in a random, uncontrolled fashion for 1d3 rounds and then dissipates. (You can't regain control of the cyclone, even if it comes back within range.)</p><p>Any Large or smaller creature that comes in contact with the spell effect must succeed on a Reflex save or take 3d6 points of damage. A Medium or smaller creature that fails its first save must succeed on a second one or be picked up bodily by the cyclone and held suspended in its powerful winds, taking 1d8 points of damage each round on your turn with no save allowed. You may direct the cyclone to eject any carried creatures whenever you wish, depositing the hapless souls wherever the cyclone happens to be when they are released.</p>
Wish	Wish	universal	sorcerer/wizard 9	1 standard action	V, S, M (diamond worth 25,000 gp)	see text	see text	see text	none, see text	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p><i>Wish </i>is the mightiest spell a wizard or sorcerer can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality to better suit you. Even <i>wish</i>, however, has its limits. A <i>wish </i>can produce any one of the following effects.</p><p>You may try to use a <i>wish </i>to produce greater effects than these, but doing so is dangerous. (The <i>wish </i>may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment, at the GM's discretion.)</p><p>Duplicated spells allow saves and spell resistance as normal (but save DCs are for 9th-level spells).</p><p>When a <i>wish </i>duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 10,000 gp, you must provide that component (in addition to the 25,000 gp diamond component for this spell).</p>
Word of Chaos	Word of Chaos	evocation [chaotic, sonic]	cleric 7	1 standard action	V	40 ft.	nonchaotic creatures in a 40-ft.-radius spread centered on you	instantaneous	none or Will negates; see text	yes	<h>Normal Use</h><p>Any nonchaotic creature within the area of a <i>word of chaos </i>spell suffers the following ill effects, depending on their HD.</p><p>The effects are cumulative and concurrent. A successful Will save reduces or eliminates these effects. Creatures affected by multiple effects make only one save and apply the result to all the effects.</p><p><i>Deafened</i>: The creature is deafened for 1d4 rounds. Save negates.</p><p><i>Stunned</i>: The creature is stunned for 1 round. Save negates.</p><p><i>Confused</i>: The creature is confused for 1d10 minutes. This is a mind-affecting enchantment effect. Save reduces the confused effect to 1 round.</p><p><i>Killed</i>: Living creatures die. Undead creatures are destroyed. Save negates. If the save is successful, the creature instead takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25).</p><p>Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast this spell, nonchaotic extraplanar creatures within the area are instantly banished back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return for at least 24 hours. This effect takes place regardless of whether the creatures hear the <i>word of chaos </i>or not<i>. </i>The banishment effect allows a Will save (at a -4 penalty) to negate.</p><p>Creatures whose HD exceed your caster level are unaffected by <i>word of chaos.</i></p>
