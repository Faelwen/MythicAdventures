Extra-Mythic-Power-Su	Extra Mythic Power (Su)	<p>You can call upon your mythic power two additional times per day. You can select this ability up to three times.</p>
Legendary-Item-Ex	Legendary Item (Ex)	<p>You gain a legendary item. This item grants a number of abilities equal to your tier (maximum 3). At 3rd tier, you can select this ability again, increasing the maximum to six abilities and causing the item to become a lesser artifact. At 6th tier, you can select this ability again, increasing the maximum to 10 abilities; the item then becomes a greater artifact.</p>
Longevity-Su	Longevity (Su)	<p>Upon taking this ability, you can no longer die from old age. If you have penalties to your physical ability scores due to aging, you no longer take those penalties. You still continue to age, and you gain all the benefits to your mental ability scores.</p>
Mythic-Craft-Ex	Mythic Craft (Ex)	<p>When you use the Craft skill to create an item, you double the progress each check provides. In addition, you can make an item masterwork simply by paying for the cost, and don't need to increase the time to create the item or attempt additional checks. Add your tier to any skill checks associated with making magic items.</p>
Mythic-Spellcasting-Ex	Mythic Spellcasting (Ex)	<p>You can learn a number of mythic spells equal to your tier and can expend mythic power when casting them to enhance the results. To select a mythic spell, you must be able to cast the non-mythic version or have it on your list of spells known. Every time you gain a new tier, you can select an additional mythic spell. You can take this ability up to three times. Each additional time you take it, you can select an additional number of spells equal to your tier and you gain one additional mythic spell whenever you gain a tier.</p>
Mythic-Sustenance-Su	Mythic Sustenance (Su)	<p>Your mythic power is enough to sustain you. You no longer need to eat, drink, or breathe to live. You're immune to inhaled poisons and any spell or effect that requires breathing, though you are still affected by any food or drink you intake.</p>
Pierce-the-Darkness-Sp	Pierce the Darkness (Sp)	<p>You gain permanent darkvision with a 60-foot range, as the universal monster ability. If you possess darkvision, the range increases by 60 feet.</p>
Beyond-Morality-Ex	Beyond Morality (Ex)	<p>You have no alignment. You can become a member of any class, even one with an alignment requirement, and can never lose your membership because of a change in alignment. If you violate the code of ethics of any of your classes, you might still lose access to certain features of such classes, subject to GM discretion. Attempts to detect your alignment don't return any results. If a class restricts you from casting spells with an alignment descriptor, you can cast such spells without restrictions or repercussions. If you're the target of a spell or effect that is based on alignment, you're treated as the most favorable alignment when determining the spell's effect on you. Any effects that alter alignment have no effect on you. If you lose this effect, you revert to your previous alignment.</p>
Divine-Source-Su	Divine Source (Su)	<p>You can grant divine spells to those who follow your cause, allowing them to select you as their deity for the purposes of determining their spells and domains. Select two domains upon taking this ability. These domains must be alignment domains matching your alignment if possible, unless your alignment is neutral. You grant access to these domains as if you were a deity. Creatures that gain spells from you don't receive any spells per day of levels higher than your tier; they lose those spell slots. In addition, you can cast spells from domains you grant as long as their level is equal to or less than your tier. Each day as a spell-like ability, you can cast one spell of each level equal to or less than your tier (selecting from those available to you from your divine source domains). If you're a cleric or you venerate a deity, you may change your spell domains to those you grant others. At 6th tier and 9th tier, you can select this ability again, adding one domain and two subdomains (see the <i>Advanced Player's Guide</i>) to your list each time and adding their spells to the list of those that you can cast.</p>
Enhanced-Ability-Ex	Enhanced Ability (Ex)	<p>You gain a permanent +2 bonus to one ability score of your choice. You can select this path ability up to six times. Each time you do, it must apply to a different ability score.</p>
Fearless-Su	Fearless (Su)	<p>Few things in the world still inspire fear in you. You are immune to all fear effects from non-mythic sources. Fear effects from mythic sources count as mythic for the purposes of this ability.</p>
Pure-Body-Su	Pure Body (Su)	<p>Your body is so pure that you're immune to all non-mythic diseases and poisons. Diseases and poisons from mythic sources count as mythic for the purposes of this ability.</p>
Pure-Destiny-Su	Pure Destiny (Su)	<p>Your mythic destiny is guided by providence. You're immune to all non-mythic curses and compulsions. Curses and compulsions from mythic sources count as mythic for the purposes of this ability.</p>
Pure-Senses-Su	Pure Senses (Su)	<p>Your senses are extraordinarily keen. You're immune to blindness and deafness caused by non-mythic sources. Such effects from mythic sources count as mythic for the purposes of this ability.</p>
Sleepless-Su	Sleepless (Su)	<p>You no longer require sleep, don't become fatigued or exhausted from lack of sleep, and are immune to sleep effects. If you have abilities or class features that require rest before they can be regained, you can choose to regain them once per day by spending 1 hour in uninterrupted meditation.</p>
Ultimate-Versatility-Ex	Ultimate Versatility (Ex)	<p>Once per day, you can temporarily change one decision made for one of your class features. This change lasts for a number of minutes equal to your tier. During this time, you're treated as if you had always had the new class feature. For example, you could use this ability to change the decision made with the arcane bond class feature, causing your bonded item to disappear (along with all of its bonuses and restrictions) and a familiar to appear in its place. This doesn't affect any prepared spells or spells you have already cast. If the new ability is limited in its uses per day, you receive half the normal number of uses (minimum 1). When this ability ends, your previous choice returns with the same number of uses as before you used this ability. If you use this ability to change a class feature that grants access to spells (such as a bloodline, patron, domain, or school), you lose access to any spells from the old choice but don't gain the ability to cast new spells. When the effect ends, the previous spells return and can be cast again. You can use this ability to change a feat or skill if you receive it from a class feature, but any other abilities that rely on the missing feat or skill as a prerequisite don't function while this ability is in effect.</p>
Unchanging-Su	Unchanging (Su)	<p>Your form is so stable that you become immune to non-mythic polymorph and petrification effects. Polymorph and petrification from mythic sources count as mythic for the purposes of this ability.</p>
Farwalker-Sp	Farwalker (Sp)	<p>The boundaries of the Material Plane mean little to you. You can <i>plane shift </i>once per day, using double your tier as your caster level. You can take this ability twice. When you take it a second time, you can use this ability three times per day.</p>
Mythic-Presence-Su	Mythic Presence (Su)	<p>Your power unnerves ordinary mortals. By expending one use of mythic power, you gain an effect similar to frightful presence, except that creatures are affected according to their tier (or rank, in the case of monsters) instead of their Hit Dice. Non-mythic creatures that fail their saves are panicked for 1 minute, and those that succeed are shaken for 1 minute. Creatures with a mythic tier or rank equal to or less than your tier are unaffected if they succeed, and are shaken for 1 minute if they fail. Creatures with a mythic tier or rank higher than yours are unaffected by your mythic presence. The Will save against your mythic presence equals 10 + your tier + your Charisma modifier. This ability lasts for 1 minute and has a range of 30 feet.</p>
Mythic-Sight-Sp	Mythic Sight (Sp)	<p>When you take this ability, you gain blindsense out to a range of 30 feet. You can take this ability twice. The second time you take it, you can see illusions and magical deceptions for what they truly are, as if using <i>true seeing</i>. This ability doesn't apply to illusions and magical effects that were cast by other mythic creatures or that are affecting other mythic creatures. If this ability is dispelled, you can resume it as a free action.</p>
Tongues-Sp	Tongues (Sp)	<p>You can understand and speak any language, as the <i>tongues</i> spell. If this ability is dispelled, you can resume it as a free action.</p>
