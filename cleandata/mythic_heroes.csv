Mythic-Power-Su	Mythic Power (Su)	<p>Mythic characters can draw upon a wellspring of power to accomplish amazing deeds and cheat fate. This power is used by a number of different abilities. Each day, you can expend an amount of mythic power equal to 3 plus double your mythic tier (5/day at 1st tier, 7/day at 2nd, etc.). This amount is your maximum amount of mythic power. If an ability allows you to regain uses of your mythic power, you can never have more than this amount.</p>
Surge-Su	Surge (Su)	<p>You can call upon your mythic power to overcome difficult challenges. You can expend one use of mythic power to increase any d20 roll you just made by rolling 1d6 and adding it to the result. Using this ability is an immediate action taken after the result of the original roll is revealed. This can change the outcome of the roll. The bonus die gained by using this ability increases to 1d8 at 4th tier, 1d10 at 7th tier, and 1d12 at 10th tier.</p>
Amazing-Initiative-Ex	Amazing Initiative (Ex)	<p>At 2nd tier, you gain a bonus on initiative checks equal to your mythic tier. In addition, as a free action on your turn, you can expend one use of mythic power to take an additional standard action during that turn. This additional standard action can't be used to cast a spell. You can't gain an extra action in this way more than once per round.</p>
Recuperation-Ex	Recuperation (Ex)	<p>At 3rd tier, you are restored to full hit points after 8 hours of rest so long as you aren't dead. In addition, by expending one use of mythic power and resting for 1 hour, you regain a number of hit points equal to half your full hit points (up to a maximum of your full hit points) and regain the use of any class features that are limited to a certain number of uses per day (such as barbarian rage, bardic performance, spells per day, and so on). This rest is treated as 8 hours of sleep for such abilities. This rest doesn't refresh uses of mythic power or any mythic abilities that are limited to a number of times per day.</p>
Mythic-Saving-Throws-Ex	Mythic Saving Throws (Ex)	<p>At 5th tier, whenever you succeed at a saving throw against a spell or special ability, you suffer no effects as long as that ability didn't come from a mythic source (such as a creature with a mythic tier or mythic ranks). If you fail a saving throw that results from a mythic source, you take the full effects as normal.</p>
Force-of-Will-Ex	Force of Will (Ex)	<p>At 7th tier, you can exert your will to force events to unfold as you would like. As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to reroll a d20 roll you just made, or force any non-mythic creature to reroll a d20 roll it just made. You can use this ability after the results are revealed. Whoever rerolls a roll must take the result of the second roll, even if it is lower.</p>
Unstoppable-Ex	Unstoppable (Ex)	<p>At 8th tier, you can expend one use of mythic power as a free action to immediately end any one of the following conditions currently affecting you: bleed, blind, confused, cowering, dazed, dazzled, deafened, entangled, exhausted, fascinated, fatigued, frightened, nauseated, panicked, paralyzed, shaken, sickened, staggered, or stunned. All other conditions and effects remain, even those resulting from the same spell or effect that caused the selected condition. You can use this ability at the start of your turn even if a condition would prevent you from acting.</p>
Immortal-Su	Immortal (Su)	<p>At 9th tier, if you are killed, you return to life 24 hours later, regardless of the condition of your body or the means by which you were killed. When you return to life, you aren't treated as if you had rested, and don't regain the use of abilities that recharge with rest until you next rest. This ability doesn't apply if you're killed by a coup de grace or critical hit performed by either a mythic creature (or creature of even greater power) or a non-mythic creature wielding a weapon capable of bypassing epic damage reduction. At 10th tier, you can be killed only by a coup de grace or critical hit made with an artifact.</p>
Legendary-Hero-Su	Legendary Hero (Su)	<p>At 10th tier, you have reached the height of mortal power. You regain uses of your mythic power at the rate of one use per hour, in addition to completely refreshing your uses each day.</p>
Commune-with-Power-Su	Commune with Power (Su)	<p>You can tap into your mythic nature to seek answers to the quandaries you encounter in your adventures. Once per day, in a special ritual that requires you to spend 1 hour of uninterrupted meditation, you can commune with the source of your power. This acts as the <i>commune</i> spell, using your tier as your caster level. The source of your power may be limited in the knowledge it possesses or can deliver, as decided upon by the GM.</p>
Display-of-Charisma-Su	Display of Charisma (Su)	<p>As a free action, you can expend one use of mythic power to attempt a feat of Charisma, gaining a +20 circumstance bonus on one Charisma-based skill check or Charisma ability check.</p>
Display-of-Constitution-Su	Display of Constitution (Su)	<p>As a free action, you can expend one use of mythic power to attempt a feat of Constitution, gaining a +20 circumstance bonus on one Constitution ability check.

Extra-Mythic-Power-Su	Extra Mythic Power (Su)	<p>You can call upon your mythic power two additional times per day. You can select this ability up to three times.</p>
Legendary-Item-Ex	Legendary Item (Ex)	<p>You gain a legendary item. This item grants a number of abilities equal to your tier (maximum 3). At 3rd tier, you can select this ability again, increasing the maximum to six abilities and causing the item to become a lesser artifact. At 6th tier, you can select this ability again, increasing the maximum to 10 abilities; the item then becomes a greater artifact.</p>
Longevity-Su	Longevity (Su)	<p>Upon taking this ability, you can no longer die from old age. If you have penalties to your physical ability scores due to aging, you no longer take those penalties. You still continue to age, and you gain all the benefits to your mental ability scores.</p>
Mythic-Craft-Ex	Mythic Craft (Ex)	<p>When you use the Craft skill to create an item, you double the progress each check provides. In addition, you can make an item masterwork simply by paying for the cost, and don't need to increase the time to create the item or attempt additional checks. Add your tier to any skill checks associated with making magic items.</p>
Mythic-Spellcasting-Ex	Mythic Spellcasting (Ex)	<p>You can learn a number of mythic spells equal to your tier and can expend mythic power when casting them to enhance the results. To select a mythic spell, you must be able to cast the non-mythic version or have it on your list of spells known. Every time you gain a new tier, you can select an additional mythic spell. You can take this ability up to three times. Each additional time you take it, you can select an additional number of spells equal to your tier and you gain one additional mythic spell whenever you gain a tier.</p>
Mythic-Sustenance-Su	Mythic Sustenance (Su)	<p>Your mythic power is enough to sustain you. You no longer need to eat, drink, or breathe to live. You're immune to inhaled poisons and any spell or effect that requires breathing, though you are still affected by any food or drink you intake.</p>
Pierce-the-Darkness-Sp	Pierce the Darkness (Sp)	<p>You gain permanent darkvision with a 60-foot range, as the universal monster ability. If you possess darkvision, the range increases by 60 feet.</p>
Beyond-Morality-Ex	Beyond Morality (Ex)	<p>You have no alignment. You can become a member of any class, even one with an alignment requirement, and can never lose your membership because of a change in alignment. If you violate the code of ethics of any of your classes, you might still lose access to certain features of such classes, subject to GM discretion. Attempts to detect your alignment don't return any results. If a class restricts you from casting spells with an alignment descriptor, you can cast such spells without restrictions or repercussions. If you're the target of a spell or effect that is based on alignment, you're treated as the most favorable alignment when determining the spell's effect on you. Any effects that alter alignment have no effect on you. If you lose this effect, you revert to your previous alignment.</p>
Divine-Source-Su	Divine Source (Su)	<p>You can grant divine spells to those who follow your cause, allowing them to select you as their deity for the purposes of determining their spells and domains. Select two domains upon taking this ability. These domains must be alignment domains matching your alignment if possible, unless your alignment is neutral. You grant access to these domains as if you were a deity. Creatures that gain spells from you don't receive any spells per day of levels higher than your tier; they lose those spell slots. In addition, you can cast spells from domains you grant as long as their level is equal to or less than your tier. Each day as a spell-like ability, you can cast one spell of each level equal to or less than your tier (selecting from those available to you from your divine source domains). If you're a cleric or you venerate a deity, you may change your spell domains to those you grant others. At 6th tier and 9th tier, you can select this ability again, adding one domain and two subdomains (see the <i>Advanced Player's Guide</i>) to your list each time and adding their spells to the list of those that you can cast.</p>
Enhanced-Ability-Ex	Enhanced Ability (Ex)	<p>You gain a permanent +2 bonus to one ability score of your choice. You can select this path ability up to six times. Each time you do, it must apply to a different ability score.</p>
Fearless-Su	Fearless (Su)	<p>Few things in the world still inspire fear in you. You are immune to all fear effects from non-mythic sources. Fear effects from mythic sources count as mythic for the purposes of this ability.</p>
Pure-Body-Su	Pure Body (Su)	<p>Your body is so pure that you're immune to all non-mythic diseases and poisons. Diseases and poisons from mythic sources count as mythic for the purposes of this ability.</p>
Pure-Destiny-Su	Pure Destiny (Su)	<p>Your mythic destiny is guided by providence. You're immune to all non-mythic curses and compulsions. Curses and compulsions from mythic sources count as mythic for the purposes of this ability.</p>
Pure-Senses-Su	Pure Senses (Su)	<p>Your senses are extraordinarily keen. You're immune to blindness and deafness caused by non-mythic sources. Such effects from mythic sources count as mythic for the purposes of this ability.</p>
Sleepless-Su	Sleepless (Su)	<p>You no longer require sleep, don't become fatigued or exhausted from lack of sleep, and are immune to sleep effects. If you have abilities or class features that require rest before they can be regained, you can choose to regain them once per day by spending 1 hour in uninterrupted meditation.</p>
Ultimate-Versatility-Ex	Ultimate Versatility (Ex)	<p>Once per day, you can temporarily change one decision made for one of your class features. This change lasts for a number of minutes equal to your tier. During this time, you're treated as if you had always had the new class feature. For example, you could use this ability to change the decision made with the arcane bond class feature, causing your bonded item to disappear (along with all of its bonuses and restrictions) and a familiar to appear in its place. This doesn't affect any prepared spells or spells you have already cast. If the new ability is limited in its uses per day, you receive half the normal number of uses (minimum 1). When this ability ends, your previous choice returns with the same number of uses as before you used this ability. If you use this ability to change a class feature that grants access to spells (such as a bloodline, patron, domain, or school), you lose access to any spells from the old choice but don't gain the ability to cast new spells. When the effect ends, the previous spells return and can be cast again. You can use this ability to change a feat or skill if you receive it from a class feature, but any other abilities that rely on the missing feat or skill as a prerequisite don't function while this ability is in effect.</p>
Unchanging-Su	Unchanging (Su)	<p>Your form is so stable that you become immune to non-mythic polymorph and petrification effects. Polymorph and petrification from mythic sources count as mythic for the purposes of this ability.</p>
Farwalker-Sp	Farwalker (Sp)	<p>The boundaries of the Material Plane mean little to you. You can <i>plane shift </i>once per day, using double your tier as your caster level. You can take this ability twice. When you take it a second time, you can use this ability three times per day.</p>
Mythic-Presence-Su	Mythic Presence (Su)	<p>Your power unnerves ordinary mortals. By expending one use of mythic power, you gain an effect similar to frightful presence, except that creatures are affected according to their tier (or rank, in the case of monsters) instead of their Hit Dice. Non-mythic creatures that fail their saves are panicked for 1 minute, and those that succeed are shaken for 1 minute. Creatures with a mythic tier or rank equal to or less than your tier are unaffected if they succeed, and are shaken for 1 minute if they fail. Creatures with a mythic tier or rank higher than yours are unaffected by your mythic presence. The Will save against your mythic presence equals 10 + your tier + your Charisma modifier. This ability lasts for 1 minute and has a range of 30 feet.</p>
Mythic-Sight-Sp	Mythic Sight (Sp)	<p>When you take this ability, you gain blindsense out to a range of 30 feet. You can take this ability twice. The second time you take it, you can see illusions and magical deceptions for what they truly are, as if using <i>true seeing</i>. This ability doesn't apply to illusions and magical effects that were cast by other mythic creatures or that are affecting other mythic creatures. If this ability is dispelled, you can resume it as a free action.</p>
Tongues-Sp	Tongues (Sp)	<p>You can understand and speak any language, as the <i>tongues</i> spell. If this ability is dispelled, you can resume it as a free action.</p>
