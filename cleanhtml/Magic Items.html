power of mythic foes.</p>\n<p>Armor and Shield Special Abilities Specific Armor and Shields Weapon Special Abilities Specific Weapons Other Magic Items</p>\n<h>Armor and Shield Special Abilities</h>\n<p>The following armor special abilities feature additional effects that triggers on the use of mythic power.</p>\n<p>Deflecting</p>\n<p><b>Price</b> +3 bonus; <b>Aura</b> strong abjuration; <b>CL</b> 13th; <b>Weight</b> \xe2&#8364;&#8221;</p>\n<p>Three times per day, the wearer of a shield with this ability can cause a group of two dozen small, shiny metal plates to dislodge from the shield and orbit his immediate area. These metal plates protect the wearer and his allies from attacks, granting him and all allies within 10 feet a deflection bonus to AC. This bonus is equal to the shield\'s enhancement bonus. This ability lasts for 1 minute or until dismissed as a free action. A mythic wearer can expend one use of mythic power when using this ability to increase the deflection bonus granted by the shield by half his mythic tier (minimum 1). This ability can be applied only to steel shields.</p>\n<p>Construction Requirements</p>\n<p>Cost +3 bonus</p>\n<p>Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Mythic Crafter, <i>deflection</i></p>\n<p>Denying</p>\n<p><b>Price</b> +4 bonus; <b>Aura</b> strong abjuration; <b>CL</b> 13th; <b>Weight</b> \xe2&#8364;&#8221;</p>\n<p>Once per day, when this armor\'s wearer is subject to either a critical hit or a sneak attack made with a melee weapon, she can automatically negate that critical or sneak attack and make it a normal attack. If the attack is both a sneak attack and a critical hit, the wearer must decide which of those she wants to negate before the damage is rolled. One use of this special ability doesn\'t negate both. A mythic wearer can expend two uses of mythic power to use this ability an additional time per day, and can even expend two more uses of mythic power to negate both a critical hit and sneak attack from the same attack. This ability can be applied only to heavy armors.</p>\n<p>Construction Requirements</p>\n<p>Cost +4 bonus</p>\n<p>Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Mythic Crafter, <i>limited wish</i> or <i>miracle</i><span></span></p>\n<p>Resonating</p>\n<p><b>Price</b> +1 bonus; <b>Aura</b> moderate abjuration; <b>CL</b> 7th; <b>Weight</b> \xe2&#8364;&#8221;</p>\n<p>Three times per day, when the wearer expends at least one use of mythic power on his turn, this armor surges with sympathetic power. Its enhancement bonus increases by 2, and any damage reduction the wearer has increases by 5. This lasts for a number of rounds equal to the wearer\'s tier, and doesn\'t stack with itself.</p>\n<p>Construction Requirements</p>\n<p>Cost +1 bonus</p>\n<p>Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Mythic Crafter, <i>lend power</i></p>\n<h>Specific Armors and Shields</h>\n<p>These armors can be used by anyone, but have greater function when worn by a mythic creature.</p>\n<p>Bastion of the Inheritor</p>\n<p><b>Price</b> 22,170 gp; <b>Slot</b> shield; <b>CL</b> 5th; <b>Weight</b> 15 lbs.; <b>Aura</b> faint abjuration</p>\n<p>This <i>+1 rallying</i> <i>heavy steel shield</i> When using this shield, the wearer reduces the extra damage she takes from <i>anarchic</i> weapons, smite good, smite law, and <i>unholy </i>weapons by her tier, to a minimum of 0. When its wearer uses the smite evil class feature, she can expend one use of mythic power to extend the deflection bonus to AC she gains against her target to all allies in a 10-foot-radius burst centered on her. This bonus lasts for 1 minute or until the smite evil ends, whichever comes first.</p>\n<p>Construction Requirements</p>\n<p>Cost 11,170 gp</p>\n<p>Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Mythic Crafter, <i>magic circle against evil</i>, <i>remove fear</i>, <i>sanctify armor</i></p>\n<p>Spiritwalk Armor</p>\n<p><b>Price</b> 25,160 gp; <b>Slot</b> armor; <b>CL</b> 11th; <b>Weight</b> 15 lbs.; <b>Aura</b> strong illusion and transmutation</p>\n<p>This <i>+2 improved shadow leather armor</i> is attractive, yet eerie. It grants its wearer the ability to use <i>vanish</i> as a quickened spell-like ability five times per day. If a mythic wearer uses the <i>vanish</i> ability, he can expend one use of mythic power to also make himself incorporeal for 1 round.</p>\n<p>Construction Requirements</p>\n<p>Cost 12,660 gp</p>\n<p>Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Mythic Crafter, <i>vanish</i>, <i>ethereal jaunt</i></p>\n<p>Stalwart Breastplate</p>\n<p><b>Price</b> 22,350 gp; <b>Slot</b> armor; <b>CL</b> 13th; <b>Weight</b> 40 lbs.; <b>Aura</b> strong abjuration</p>\n<p>The burden of this weighty <i>+1 light fortification breastplate</i> gives it an armor check penalty of \xe2&#8364;&#8220;5. As an immediate action, the wearer can negate the effects of a successful combat maneuver made to bull rush, overrun, or trip her. As a swift action, the wearer can expend one use of mythic power to gain immunity to ability damage, ability drain, critical hits, and sneak attacks. This effect lasts for 1 round per mythic tier the wearer possesses.</p>\n<p>Construction Requirements</p>\n<p>Cost 11,350 gp</p>\n<p>Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Mythic Crafter, <i>iron body</i>, either <i>limited wish</i> or <i>miracle</i></p>\n<h>Weapon Special Abilities</h>\n<p>These weapon special abilities either enhance or interact with mythic creatures. Some can steal mythic power or block the ability to use it.</p>\n<p>Disjoining</p>\n<p><b>Price</b> +1 bonus; <b>Aura</b> moderate necromancy; <b>CL</b> 7th; <b>Weight</b> \xe2&#8364;&#8221;</p>\n<p>These weapons were first created by deities and given to mortals so that they could combat mythic foes. When the wielder confirms a critical hit against a mythic creature with a <i>disjoining</i> weapon, the target loses the ability to expend its mythic power for 1d4 rounds. A mythic creature wielding a <i>disjoining</i> weapon loses the ability to expend uses of mythic power for as long as he wields the weapon. Only melee weapons can have this ability.</p>\n<p>Construction Requirements</p>\n<p>Cost +1 bonus</p>\n<p>Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Mythic Crafter, <i>mythic severance</i></p>\n<p>Harvesting</p>\n<p><b>Price</b> +2 bonus; <b>Aura</b> moderate necromancy; <b>CL</b> 9th; <b>Weight</b> \xe2&#8364;&#8221;</p>\n<p>A <i>harvesting</i> weapon siphons away mythic power from one mythic creature to empower another. Whenever a mythic wielder confirms a critical hit against another mythic creature, the weapon leeches away one use of the target\'s mythic power and transfers it to the wielder. If the wielder already has her maximum number of uses of mythic power, the target\'s use of mythic power is still leeched, but the wielder doesn\'t gain it. The weapon can do this a number of times per day equal to the enhancement bonus of the weapon.</p>\n<p>If the <i>harvesting</i> weapon is a legendary item, the wielder can have the mythic power that is leeched replenish one of that weapon\'s uses of legendary power. Only melee weapons can have this ability.</p>\n<p>Construction Requirements</p>\n<p>Cost +2 bonus</p>\n<p>Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Mythic Crafter, <i>steal power</i><span></span></p>\n<p>Mythic Bane</p>\n<p><b>Price</b> +1 bonus; <b>Aura</b> moderate evocation; <b>CL</b> 8th; <b>Weight</b> \xe2&#8364;&#8221;</p>\n<p>A <i>mythic bane</i> weapon works exactly like a <i>bane</i> weapon, except it has a higher bonus and deals extra damage against any creature with the mythic subtype. This ability stacks with the <i>bane</i> weapon special ability.</p>\n<p>Construction Requirements</p>\n<p>Cost +1 bonus</p>\n<p>Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Mythic Crafter, <i>divine favor</i></p>\n<p>Potent</p>\n<p><b>Price</b> +2 bonus; <b>Aura</b> strong transmutation; <b>CL</b> 12th; <b>Weight</b> \xe2&#8364;&#8221;</p>\n<p>As a swift action, the wielder can expend one use of mythic power to increase the weapon\'s enhancement bonus by half his mythic tier (minimum 1, to a maximum of a +6 enhancement bonus) and give it the ability to bypass damage reduction. These benefits last for 1 round. Melee and ranged weapons can have this ability, but not ammunition.</p>\n<p>Construction Requirements</p>\n<p>Cost +2 bonus</p>\n<p>Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Mythic Crafter, <i>greater heroism</i>, <i>greater magic weapon</i></p>\n<p>Sacrosanct</p>\n<p><b>Price</b> +5,000 gp; <b>Aura</b> moderate evocation; <b>CL</b> 8th; <b>Weight</b> \xe2&#8364;&#8221;</p>\n<p>Taking the form of a deity\'s favored weapon, a <i>sacrosanct</i> weapon serves as both a martial implement and the corresponding deity\'s holy (or unholy) symbol. Once per day when the wielder uses the <i>sacrosanct</i> weapon to channel energy, she can increase the radius of the channel energy to 40 feet. They wielder must be able to channel positive or negative energy to use this ability.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the wielder can expend one use of mythic power to use this ability instead of expending its daily use. When using mythic power to activate this ability, it can be done at will.</p>\n<p>Construction Requirements</p>\n<p>Cost +5,000 gp</p>\n<p>Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Mythic Crafter, the crafter must be able to channel energy</p>\n<h>Specific Weapons</h>\n<p>These majestic weapons are fit for mythic creatures.</p>\n<p>Bow of Erastil</p>\n<p><b>Price</b> 38,000 gp; <b>Slot</b> none; <b>CL</b> 15th; <b>Weight</b> 5 lbs.; <b>Aura</b> strong transmutation</p>\n<p>This golden <i>+1 endless ammunition distance composite longbow</i> (+6 Str) produces a golden arrow whenever it\'s drawn. By expending one use of mythic power, the bow\'s wielder can make a single attack and compare the result against every enemy within 60 feet of her. The wielder rolls damage only once, and applies it to all foes hit by the attack. If the attack is a critical threat, the wielder chooses only one enemy hit and attempts to confirm the critical against that enemy.</p>\n<p>Construction Requirements</p>\n<p>Cost 19,500 gp</p>\n<p>Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Mythic Crafter, <i>clairaudience/clairvoyance</i>, <i>haste</i></p>\n<p>Brutal Axe</p>\n<p><b>Price</b> 21,320 gp; <b>Slot</b> none; <b>CL</b> 11th; <b>Weight</b> 12 lbs.; <b>Aura</b> moderate transmutation</p>\n<p>The haft of this <i>+1 adamantine greataxe</i> is carved from the limb of a treant slain by fire. While wielding this axe, a creature is considered to have the Improved Sunder feat. It also deals an additional 1d12 points of damage when used to sunder. If the wielder already has Improved Sunder, the axe grants Greater Sunder; and if the wielder already has Greater Sunder, it instead provides a further +2 bonus on sunder combat maneuver checks.</p>\n<p>As an immediate action after making a successful attack with the axe, the wielder can expend one use of mythic power to make a combat maneuver check to sunder a single item being used by the creature he just successfully attacked. This sunder attempt deals double damage and uses the wielder\'s full base attack bonus. If the item is destroyed by this sunder attempt, no excess damage is applied to the item\'s wielder or other items.</p>\n<p>Construction Requirements</p>\n<p>Cost 12,320 gp</p>\n<p>Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Mythic Crafter, <i>bull\'s strength</i>, <i>ironwood</i></p>\n<p>Chaos Hammer</p>\n<p><b>Price</b> 38,312 gp; <b>Slot</b> none; <b>CL</b> 9th; <b>Weight</b> 10 lbs.; <b>Aura</b> moderate evocation [chaotic]</p>\n<p>This oversized hammer crackles with chaotic energy. Once per day as a standard action, the wielder of this <i>+1 anarchic warhammer</i> can strike the ground to create the effects of the <i>chaos hammer</i> spell (Will DC 16, CL 9th) that bursts out from the warhammer\'s wielder. A mythic creature wielding this weapon can expend one use of mythic power to activate this ability without using up its daily use.</p>\n<p>Construction Requirements</p>\n<p>Cost 19,312 gp</p>\n<p>Craft Wondrous Item, Mythic Crafter, <i>align weapon</i>, <i>chaos hammer</i>, creator must be chaotic</p>\n<p>Dagger of a Thousand Bites</p>\n<p><b>Price</b> 24,502 gp; <b>Slot</b> none; <b>CL</b> 18th; <b>Weight</b> 1/2 lb.; <b>Aura</b> strong conjuration</p>\n<p>This <i>+1 keen returning mithral dagger</i> is bleached pale white like some sort of giant tooth. The wielder can expend one use of mythic power when throwing the dagger. When the dagger is thrown in this fashion and hits its target, it can be directed to strike a different target within 30 feet of the first. The new target must still be within the attacker\'s line of sight. This additional attack is made using the same attack bonus as the first, though range penalties apply based on the total distance the dagger flies.</p>\n<p>The dagger\'s wielder can continue selecting additional targets within his line of sight until the dagger misses, though no creature can be targeted by the dagger more than once in the same round.</p>\n<p>Construction Requirements</p>\n<p>Cost 12,502 gp</p>\n<p>Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Mythic Crafter, <i>greater magic weapon</i>, <i>keen edge</i>, <i>telekinesis</i></p>\n<p>Dragonbreath Bow</p>\n<p><b>Price</b> 50,375 gp; <b>Slot</b> none; <b>CL</b> 14th; <b>Weight</b> 3 lbs.; <b>Aura</b> strong evocation</p>\n<p>This <i>+2 flaming burst longbow</i>\'s arrow rest is shaped like a dragon\'s head with its mouth agape\xe2&#8364;&#8221;as if about to unleash its breath weapon. A mythic wielder can expend one use of mythic power when drawing back the bow to create an arrow of pure flame. This flame arrow acts as a ranged touch attack that can target only creatures within the first range increment of the bow. When it hits its target, this flame arrow deals 3d10+2 points of fire damage. This damage stacks with the bow\'s <i>flaming burst</i> special ability.</p>\n<p>Construction Requirements</p>\n<p>Cost 25,375 gp</p>\n<p>Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Mythic Crafter, <i>flame strike</i>, <i>scorching ray</i></p>\n<p>Fire Goddess\'s Blade</p>\n<p><b>Price</b> 33,315 gp; <b>Slot</b> none; <b>CL</b> 18th; <b>Weight</b> 4 lbs.; <b>Aura</b> strong conjuration and transmutation</p>\n<p>This <i>+1 flaming scimitar</i> has golden flames embossed along the blade, which flicker and glow even when the sword\'s flames are extinguished. Three times per day as a swift action, its wielder can transform the sword into a blade of pure flame. In this form, the blade deals 1d8+9 points of fire damage (as the <i>flame blade</i> spell).</p>\n<p>Once per day, the sword\'s wielder can expend one use of mythic power to transform the blade into a Large fire elemental for 10 minutes. When the duration ends or the fire elemental is defeated, the blade reappears in its owner\'s hands.</p>\n<p>Construction Requirements</p>\n<p>Cost 16,815 gp</p>\n<p>Craft Wondrous Item, Mythic Crafter, <i>flame blade</i>, <i>greater magic weapon</i></p>\n<p>Gun With No Name</p>\n<p><b>Price</b> 98,300 gp; <b>Slot</b> none; <b>CL</b> 9th; <b>Weight</b> 5 lbs.; <b>Aura</b> moderate abjuration and conjuration</p>\n<p>Though the green, glowing runes on this firearm denote it as magical, otherwise this <i>+2 mythic bane greater lucky</i> <i>pepperbox</i> appears beat up and nearly useless. This weapon can be reloaded normally, but if its wielder expends either one use of mythic power or 1 grit point as a swift action, each of the firearm\'s empty barrels magically reloads with either black powder and a bullet or with a flare alchemical cartridge (the wielder chooses, and she can mix and match the ammunition type with each barrel). While carrying this firearm, the wielder is immune to scrying and any form of divination that attempts to ascertain her location, thoughts, or alignment. The firearm itself is immune to <i>locate object</i> and similar effects.</p>\n<p>Construction Requirements</p>\n<p>Cost 50,800 gp</p>\n<p>Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Mythic Crafter, <i>divine favor</i>, <i>nondetection</i></p>\n<p>Pick of Stonecleaving</p>\n<p><b>Price</b> 11,308 gp; <b>Slot</b> none; <b>CL</b> 5th; <b>Weight</b> 6 lbs.; <b>Aura</b> faint evocation</p>\n<p>When this <i>+1 adamantine heavy pick</i> is used to damage unattended objects, it deals an additional 2d6 points of damage. If the wielder expends one use of mythic power when making such an attack, the pick bypasses the object\'s hardness and deals 4d6 additional damage instead of 2d6.</p>\n<p>Construction Requirements</p>\n<p>Cost 7,308 gp</p>\n<p>Craft Wondrous Item, Mythic Crafter, <i>shatter</i></p>\n<p>Sacred Avenger</p>\n<p><b>Price</b> 202,630 gp; <b>Slot</b> none; <b>CL</b> 20th; <b>Weight</b> 4 lbs.; <b>Aura</b> strong abjuration</p>\n<p>This <i>+3 cold iron longsword</i> becomes a <i>+5 holy defiant</i> <i>cold iron longsword</i> in the hands of a paladin or a lawful good mythic creature. If the creature wielding this weapon is a paladin with mythic tiers, she can also grant the weapon the <i>brilliant energy</i> special ability on command. Dismissing the <i>brilliant energy</i> ability is a free action.</p>\n<p>When wielded by a paladin or a lawful good mythic creature, this weapon provides spell resistance equal to 5 + the character\'s paladin class level (if any) + the character\'s mythic tier (if any) to the wielder and anyone within 10 feet of her. It also enables the wielder to use <i>mythic greater dispel magic</i> once per round as a standard action, with a caster level equal to either the wielder\'s paladin class level or double her mythic tier, whichever is higher. <i>Mythic greater dispel magic</i> functions as <i>greater dispel magic</i> including the benefits of the <i>mythic dispel magic</i> spell, but when the wielder dispels a spell, she heals 1d6 points of damage for every spell level of the dispelled spell instead of healing 1d4 points of damage.</p>\n<p>Construction Requirements</p>\n<p>Cost 102,630 gp</p>\n<p>Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Mythic Crafter, <i>gaseous form</i>, <i>greater dispel magic</i>, <i>holy aura</i>, creator must be good</p>\n<p>Shadow Spike</p>\n<p><b>Price</b> 96,600 gp; <b>Slot</b> none; <b>CL</b> 12th; <b>Weight</b> 4 lbs.; <b>Aura</b> strong conjuration</p>\n<p>This <i>+2/+2 cruel quarterstaff</i> is made of polished ebony, and features a blackened metal spike on its bottom end. As a standard action, the wielder can drive the spike into the ground on either the Material Plane or the Shadow Plane, creating a rift merging those two planes. This rift is 30 feet in diameter, lasts for 1 minute, and can be created once per day. If the creature that drives the <i>shadow spike</i> into the ground expends one use of mythic power when doing so, the effect lasts until the <i>shadow spike</i> is pulled out of the ground (which takes a standard action).</p>\n<p>The rift\'s area acts as the <i>deeper darkness</i> spell. Spells with the darkness or shadow descriptors cast within the rift have +1 caster level, and are affected as if cast with the Extend Spell feat. As a standard action, any mythic creature within the area can expend three uses of mythic power to <i>plane shift</i> to the Shadow Plane (if on the Material Plane) or to the Material Plane (if on the Shadow Plane). If a mythic creature <i>plane shifts</i> while holding the <i>shadow spike</i>, the weapon teleports with that creature, ending the effect.</p>\n<p>Construction Requirements</p>\n<p>Cost 48,600 gp</p>\n<p>Craft Wondrous Item, Mythic Crafter, <i>cause fear, death knell</i>, <i>deeper darkness</i>, <i>plane shift</i></p>\n<p>Shadow\'s Touch</p>\n<p><b>Price</b> 102,962 gp; <b>Slot</b> none; <b>CL</b> 13th; <b>Weight</b> 1/2 lb.; <b>Aura</b> strong illusion</p>\n<p>Amazingly light, this ebon <i>+2 keen dagger</i> fades into near intangibility at its tip. It ignores bonuses to AC provided by deflection and force effects, and deals 2 points of Strength damage on a confirmed critical hit. By expending one use of mythic power while attacking, the wielder can strike a force effect and <i>disintegrate</i> it as a touch attack. This effect also automatically dispels force effects that can be dispelled whether or not they\'re subject to <i>disintegrate</i>.</p>\n<p>As a standard action, the wielder can expend a use of mythic power while slashing at the air to open up a rift to the Shadow Plane.

If the spear hits when thrown, the wielder can, as an immediate action, expend one use of mythic power to teleport to an unoccupied space adjacent to the creature struck. This effect is treated as <i>dimension door</i>, except the wielder can act after teleporting. The spear comes back to its wielder\'s hand when he appears.

The enhanced end acts as a <i>bane</i> weapon against any creature with the ability to cast spells or use spell-like abilities. As a standard action, the wielder can strike the unenhanced end against the ground while expending one use of mythic power to produce an <i>antimagic field</i> centered on the staff. This effect has a duration of 2 hours. Anyone striking the staff against the ground a second time dismisses the effect. The <i>antimagic field</i> remains in effect if the staff is dropped or disarmed.

Once per week, the wielder can cast <i>control weather</i> for the purposes of summoning a storm or increasing the severity of an existing storm.</p>\n<p>As a full-round action, the wielder can expend one use of mythic power to call lightning down on foes he hits. This works like the <i>call lightning</i> spell (CL 13th), with the following differences. Rather than being directed as a move action, for 13 rounds the lightning is called down on the first opponent hit by the spear each round. This effect bypasses lightning resistance and treats lightning immunity as lightning resistance 10. If the wielder confirms a critical hit on an attack that calls down a lightning bolt, the lightning also deals double damage.</p>\n<p>Construction Requirements</p>\n<p>Cost 49,302 gp</p>\n<p>Craft Wondrous Item, Mythic Crafter, <i>call lightning</i>, <i>control weather</i></p>\n<p>Sword of Inner Fire</p>\n<p><b>Price</b> 151,315 gp; <b>Slot</b> none; <b>CL</b> 16th; <b>Weight</b> 4 lbs.; <b>Aura</b> strong transmutation [fire]</p>\n<p>This <i>+1 flaming burst brilliant energy longsword</i> has a burnished copper hilt and burns with blue and white flame.

Furthermore, if the wearer is a mythic creature and targeted by an effect that would teleport her, she can choose whether or not she wishes to be teleported.</p>\n<p>As a standard action, the wearer can expend one use of mythic power to create a 30-foot-radius aura that affects all enemy creatures within it as though they were subject to a <i>dimensional anchor</i> spell.

As a full-round action, a mythic creature can flip to and read an appropriate ritual of <i>banishment</i> for a particular category of extraplanar creatures, such as angels or devils. Creatures not of that category are unaffected. The reader\'s caster level for this ritual is double her mythic tier.</p>\n<p>Once the ritual is read, the book counts as an object that the chosen creatures hate and fear, granting a +2 bonus on the reader\'s caster level check to overcome the chosen creatures\' spell resistance.

The target creature is enraged per the <i>rage</i> spell, and all other enemies within 30 feet of the target begin laughing uncontrollably, as <i>hideous laughter</i> (Will DC 14 negates either effect).

To use the bottle, the inner chamber is filled with a potion and the outer chamber filled with water. When left alone for 24 hours, the water in the outer chamber slowly takes on the properties of the potion in the inner chamber, creating a second dose of the potion (though the bottle is unable to replicate potions with expensive material components). The second dose of created potion must be quaffed from the <i>bountiful bottle</i> to be effective, and loses its potency if transferred to another container. By expending one use of mythic power, the time it takes to transform a potion is shortened to a full-round action.</p>\n<p>Construction Requirements</p>\n<p>Cost 2,000 gp</p>\n<p>Craft Wondrous Item, Mythic Crafter, <i>universal formula</i></p>\n<p>Bracers of Might</p>\n<p><b>Price</b> 10,000 gp; <b>Slot</b> wrists; <b>CL</b> 10th; <b>Weight</b> 1/2 lb.; <b>Aura</b> moderate transmutation</p>\n<p>These golden bracers are sculpted to depict a pair of mighty stags rearing up in triumph.

Movement abilities are limited to a speed of no more than 60 feet, and flight can be of no greater than good maneuverability. Energy resistance can be gained in any single energy type the creature was resistant or immune to, to a maximum of 20 points (if the creature had immunity, the user gains resistance 20 to that energy type).</p>\n<p>By expending one use of mythic power, the bearer can instead take the form of the creature for 10 minutes, as if using <i>alter self</i>, <i>beast shape II</i>, <i>form of the dragon II</i>, or <i>giant form I</i>, as appropriate. The bearer resembles the original creature as it appeared in life, as though he were impersonating that creature with a Disguise check result of 20.

After this period, the suppression of morale bonuses ends and the ambient light level returns to normal. If the bearer expends one use of mythic power while striking the chime, the area increases to a 120-foot-radius burst, and each mythic enemy within it loses one use of mythic power, in addition to the chime\'s normal effects.

If the user instead expends six uses of mythic power, the helpless creature can\'t be awoken for a month. If the user expends 10 uses, the helpless creature can\'t be awoken for a year. If the user expends 20 uses, the helpless creature can\'t be awoken for an entire century.</p>\n<p>While in this sleep, the helpless creature\'s heart rate and breathing slow to a barely perceptible rate. It doesn\'t need to eat or drink, though it must still breathe and it ages normally while in this magical sleep.

The necklace can be removed as a full-round action by concentrating on the tattoo to call the necklace back into existence. While in tattoo form, the amulet grants a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with unarmed strikes (but not natural weapons) and provides the benefits of the <i>ghost touch</i> weapon special ability on unarmed strikes. As a swift action, the wearer can spend a ki point to make one unarmed strike\xe2&#8364;&#8221;whether as a single attack or part of a full attack\xe2&#8364;&#8221;an incorporeal touch attack.</p>\n<p>As an immediate action, the wearer can expend one use of mythic power to become incorporeal for 1 round. This lasts until either just before his next turn (if used during his turn) or at the end of his next turn (if used outside his turn). While incorporeal, the wearer has no Strength score, so his Dexterity modifier applies to his melee attacks, ranged attacks, and combat maneuver checks. Since the necklace provides the <i>ghost touch</i> ability, the wearer can make unarmed strikes against corporeal creatures while incorporeal. The wearer can remain inside solid objects as long as he continues expending mythic power to remain incorporeal.

While in this form, the wearer also gains a fly speed of 50 feet with good maneuverability, as well as a +4 bonus on Fly skill checks due to this maneuverability.</p>\n<p>Construction Requirements</p>\n<p>Cost 27,500 gp</p>\n<p>Craft Wondrous Item, Mythic Crafter, <i>breath of life</i>, <i>elemental body II</i></p>\n<p>Ring of Energy Dampening</p>\n<p><b>Price</b> 31,500 gp; <b>Slot</b> ring; <b>CL</b> 10th; <b>Weight</b> \xe2&#8364;&#8221;; <b>Aura</b> moderate abjuration</p>\n<p>When the wearer is about to take acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, this band of braided copper and silver writhes like a snake. It provides resistance 5 to acid, cold, electricity, and fire. The wearer can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action when taking damage of one of these types to upgrade the resistance to immunity for that attack or effect only. Also, once per day when the wearer takes damage of one of these types, the wearer can grant resistance 5 to the energy type damaging him to all allies within 20 feet. This resistance lasts for 1 minute.</p>\n<p>Construction Requirements</p>\n<p>Cost 15,750 gp</p>\n<p>Forge Ring, Mythic Crafter, <i>protection from energy</i>, <i>shield other</i></p>\n<p>Ring of Transcendent Spells</p>\n<p><b>Price</b> 30,000 gp; <b>Slot</b> ring; <b>CL</b> 13th; <b>Weight</b> \xe2&#8364;&#8221;; <b>Aura</b> strong universal</p>\n<p>This jade ring is carved in the shape of an ouroboros. Three times per day, the wearer can use it to empower a spell she casts. This grants her a +2 bonus on caster level checks to overcome spell resistance, and increases the save DC of the spell (if any) by 2.</p>\n<p>While enhancing a spell this way, the caster can expend one use of mythic power plus an additional use per two spell levels (minimum two uses), to instead cast the mythic version of her spell (though not an augmented version of the mythic spell) as if she knew the mythic version of that spell. This has no effect if the spell doesn\'t have a mythic version. The save DC increase for being a potent mythic spell stacks with the save DC increase granted by using the ring\'s power.</p>\n<p>For example, if the wearer enhances <i>fireball</i> with this ring, she can expend two uses of mythic power to cast <i>mythic fireball</i> instead (one use plus one use for a 3rd-level spell).</p>\n<p>Construction Requirements</p>\n<p>Cost 15,000 gp</p>\n<p>Forge Ring, Mythic Crafter <i>limited wish</i>, <i>mnemonic enhancer</i></p>\n<p>Root of the World Tree</p>\n<p><b>Price</b> Varies; <b>CL 17th; <b>Weight</b> \xe2&#8364;&#8221;; <b>Aura</b> strong conjuration;</b></p>\n<p><b><b>Lesser</b> 300 gp; <b>Normal</b> 1,000 gp ; Greater</b> 2,500 gp; <b>Slot</b> none;</p>\n<p>This fibrous powder is ground from bark harvested from the roots of trees growing across planar boundaries. When thrown in the air as part of casting a conjuration (summoning) spell, it grants the creatures summoned the advanced simple template. If the caster also expends one use of mythic power, the summoned creatures gain DR 5/epic, or DR 10/epic if they have at least 11 HD. Lesser root affects conjuration (summoning) spells up to 3rd level, normal root conjuration (summoning) spells up to 6th level, and greater root any conjuration (summoning) spell.</p>\n<p>Construction Requirements</p>\n<p>Cost Varies</p>\n<p><b>Lesser</b> 150 gp; <b>Normal</b> 500 gp; <b>Greater</b> 1,250 gp\n</p><p>Craft Wondrous Item, Mythic Crafter, Augment Summoning, <i>heroism</i></p>\n<p>Seven-League Boots</p>\n<p><b>Price</b> 80,000 gp; <b>Slot</b> feet; <b>CL</b> 10th; <b>Weight</b> 1 lb.; <b>Aura</b> moderate transmutation</p>\n<p>These well-worn boots act as <i>boots of speed</i> combined with <i>boots of striding and springing</i>. The wearer can expend one use of mythic power as a move action to take a 7-league step. The steps functions as teleportation with a 21-mile range, except the wearer must have an uninterrupted path to her intended destination, though this path doesn\'t have to follow a straight line. Harmful environments between the wearer and the destination cause her no harm.</p>\n<p>If the wearer\'s path is blocked, her travel ends just short of the obstacle blocking her. If she tries to step too far, she appears in the closest available space to her destination without going beyond 21 miles of where she started.</p>\n<p>Construction Requirements</p>\n<p>Cost 40,000 gp</p>\n<p>Craft Wondrous Item, Mythic Crafter, <i>expeditious retreat</i>, <i>haste</i></p>\n<p>Stonefist Gloves</p>\n<p><b>Price</b> 10,000 gp; <b>Slot</b> hands; <b>CL</b> 7th; <b>Weight</b> 3 lbs.; <b>Aura</b> moderate transmutation</p>\n<p>These heavy, stone gloves feel surprisingly supple to anyone who puts them on. While a creature wears <i>stonefist gloves</i>, his unarmed strike damage is treated as if he were one size category larger, and bypasses hardness of 8 or lower. When a mythic creature uses these gloves to make a sunder combat maneuver, he adds half his tier as a bonus on the combat maneuver check.</p>\n<p>Construction Requirements</p>\n<p>Cost 5,000 gp</p>\n<p>Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Mythic Crafter, <i>stoneskin</i></p>\n<p>Torc of Truespeech</p>\n<p><b>Price</b> 60,000 gp; <b>Slot</b> neck; <b>CL</b> 5th; <b>Weight</b> 2 lbs.; <b>Aura</b> faint divination</p>\n<p>This heavy gold torc allows its wearer\'s words to be understood by any creature that speaks a language, as though his words were spoken in that creature\'s native tongue. Each creature listening hears the words in a language appropriate to itself. The wearer can understand all spoken languages as though using the <i>tongues </i>spell. A wearer who is at least 3rd tier can speak to and be understood by animals (as if using <i>speak with animals</i>), and one who is at least 6th tier can also speak to and be understood by plants (as if using <i>speak with plants</i>).</p>\n<p>Construction Requirements</p>\n<p>Cost 30,000 gp</p>\n<p>Craft Wondrous Item, Mythic Crafter, <i>speak with animals</i>, <i>speak with plants</i>, <i>tongues</i></p>\n</div> <div>\n<p>\nReport a Problem<br/><br/>\n\t\t\t\xc2\xa92002-2016 Paizo, Inc.\xc2\xae<br/>\n\t\t\tPaizo Inc., Paizo, Pathfinder, and the Pathfinder logo are registered trademarks of Paizo Inc., and<br/>\n\t\t\tPathfinder Roleplaying Game and Pathfinder Campaign Setting are trademarks of Paizo Inc.<br/>\nOpen Game License.\n\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<script></script>\n<script></script>\n<script></script>\n<script></script>\n<script></script>\n<script>var globalTitle="Magic Items",globalNavPath=[{ href: \'/pathfinderRPG/prd/mythicAdventures/mythicItems.html\', name: \'Mythic Items\' }];</script>\n<script>\n$(function () {\n\tif(!/Android|webOS|iPhone|iPad|iPod|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) {\n\t\t\thighlightNavLocation(globalNavPath);\n\t\t}\n\t});\n</script>\n</body></html>'
