b'<h>Mythic Feats</h>\n<p>Mythic characters and monsters gain mythic feats as they gain tiers or ranks. These feats can be selected only as part of mythic advancement, not as part of a character\'s normal advancement or in place of any other bonus feat.</p>\n<p>Most mythic feats require a non-mythic feat as a prerequisite. These mythic feats enhance the benefits of their prerequisite feats, making them truly awe-inspiring. If a character doesn\'t possess any of the necessary prerequisite feats when she gains a mythic feat, she can wait to select a mythic feat until the next time she gains a tier or level.</p>\n<p>A value in a mythic feat based on a fraction of your tier (such as a +1 bonus for every 3 tiers you possess) always has a minimum of 1.</p>\n<p>This section includes some non-mythic feats. These grant a character who hasn\'t had a moment of ascension a measure of mythic might, and remain relevant if that character later becomes mythic.</p>\n<h>Types of Feats</h>\n<p>Many feats belong to a category that has special rules associated to it. This category is listed after the feat name. The following types of feats can be found in this section.</p>\n<h>Metamagic Feats</h>\n<p>Metamagic feats allow spellcasters to modify and change their spells, granting the spells new powers and effects. Such spells generally take up a higher-level spell slot than the normal spell.</p>\n<h>Mythic Feats</h>\n<p>Only characters with mythic tiers or creatures with mythic ranks can take these feats. If a creature becomes non-mythic, it no longer gains the benefit of these feats, but it doesn\'t lose them permanently. If the creature becomes mythic again, it regains the use of all the mythic feats it once had.</p>\n<p>Many mythic feats enhance non-mythic feats with the same name. When a creature has a mythic version of a feat, that feat is denoted with a superscript "M" in the feat line of its stat block.</p>\n<div>\n<table><thead><td><b>Feats</b></td><td><b>Prerequisites</b></td><td><b>Benefits</b></td></thead></table></div>\n<tr><td>Marked for Glory  </td><td>Great Fortitude, Iron Will, or

Note that the prerequisites and benefits of the feats on this table are abbreviated for ease of reference. See the feat descriptions for full details.</p>\n<p>The following format is used for all feat descriptions.</p>\n<p><b>Feat Name</b>: The feat\'s name also indicates what category, if any, the feat belongs to, and is followed by a basic description of what the feat does.</p>\n<p><b>Prerequisite</b>: A minimum ability score, another feat or feats, a minimum base attack bonus, a minimum number of ranks in one or more skills, or anything else required in order to take the feat. This entry is absent if a feat has no prerequisite. A feat may have more than one prerequisite. Being a mythic character or monster is always a prerequisite for a mythic feat.</p>\n<p><b>Benefit</b>: What the feat enables the character ("you" in the feat description) to do. If a character has the same feat more than once, its benefits do not stack unless indicated otherwise in the description.</p>\n<p><b>Normal</b>: What a character who does not have this feat is limited to or restricted from doing. If not having the feat causes no particular drawback, this entry is absent.</p>\n<p><b>Special</b>: Additional unusual facts about the feat.</p>\n<p>Accursed Hex (Mythic)</p>\n<p>Your hexes flare with persistent potency.</p>\n<p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Accursed Hex.</p>\n<p><b>Benefit</b>: When you use Accursed Hex to target a creature with one of your hexes a second time, that creature must roll its saving throw twice and take the lower result.</p>\n<p>Acrobatic (Mythic)</p>\n<p>Your grace and fluidity are beyond compare.</p>\n<p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Acrobatic.</p>\n<p><b>Benefit</b>: The bonus on Acrobatics and Fly skill checks from Acrobatic increases by 2.

Alternatively, you can expend two uses of mythic power when using Alignment Channel to affect all targets of the chosen alignment as if they had that alignment subtype.</p>\n<p>Animal Affinity (Mythic)</p>\n<p>You have a greater affinity with wild animals, and can speak with them.</p>\n<p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Animal Affinity.</p>\n<p><b>Benefit</b>: The bonus on Handle Animal and Ride skill checks from Animal Affinity increases by 2. In addition, you can expend one use of mythic power to <i>speak with animals </i>as the spell. Your caster level for this effect is equal to twice your tier.</p>\n<p>Arcane Armor Training (Mythic)</p>\n<p>You\'ve adapted your spellcasting to overcome limitations of wearing armor.</p>\n<p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Arcane Armor Training.</p>\n<p><b>Benefit</b>: You don\'t have to spend a swift action to gain the reduction to arcane spell failure chance from Arcane Armor Training. Furthermore, if you\'re wearing light armor, reduce your arcane spell failure chance by 20%.</p>\n<p>Arcane Blast (Mythic)</p>\n<p>You can manipulate raw eldritch energies to do more than just deal damage.</p>\n<p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Arcane Blast.</p>\n<p><b>Benefit</b>: When you use Arcane Blast, you may halve the damage dice to also perform your choice of either a trip or bull rush combat maneuver against the target of the blast. You can\'t move with an opponent you bull rush with this feat. You gain a bonus on your combat maneuver check for this attempt equal to half the spell level of the spell you sacrificed when using Arcane Blast, and you can substitute your Intelligence or Charisma modifier in place of your Strength modifier when determining your combat maneuver bonus.</p>\n<p>In addition, you can expend one use of mythic power to change the damage dice of your Arcane Blast to d8s instead of d6s.</p>\n<p>Arcane Shield (Mythic)</p>\n<p>You sculpt spells into a powerful, enduring arcane barriers.</p>\n<p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Arcane Shield.</p>\n<p><b>Benefit</b>: You add half your tier to the deflection bonus granted to your AC when you use your Arcane Shield.

If you expend one use of mythic power when using Arcane Strike, you can also add any one magic weapon special ability with a base price modifier of +1 to your weapons. This base price modifier increases to +2 at 4th tier, +3 at 7th tier, and +4 at 10th tier.</p>\n<p>Ascendant Spell (Metamagic)</p>\n<p>You have learned how to emulate mythic spells using non-mythic forces.</p>\n<p><b>Benefit</b>: You can modify a spell to imitate the mythic version of that spell. An ascendant spell uses the mythic version of the spell, but doesn\'t count as a mythic spell for the purposes of effects that interact with the spell, unless you are a mythic creature. You can\'t use the augmented version of the mythic spell, or use spells effects that require you to expend uses of mythic power (even if you have uses of mythic power available).</p>\n<p>An ascendant spell uses up a spell slot 5 levels higher than the spell\'s actual level.</p>\n<p>Aspect of the Beast (Mythic)</p>\n<p>Your blood burns with savage fury, giving you bestial powers and abilities.</p>\n<p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Aspect of the Beast.</p>\n<p><b>Benefit</b>: Your bestial nature manifests itself in one of the following ways. You choose the manifestation when you choose the feat, and you can\'t change it.</p>\n<p><i>Mythic Senses (Ex)</i>: If you have normal vision, you gain darkvision 30 feet. If you have low-light vision, you gain darkvision 60 feet. If you have darkvision, the range of your darkvision increases by 30 feet plus 10 feet per tier.</p>\n<p><i>Mythic Claws (Ex)</i>: You grow a pair of powerful claws. These claws are primary attacks that deal 1d4 points of damage (1d3 if you\'re Small). If you already have claws, the damage they deal increases by one die type (d4s become d6s, d3s become d4s, and so on). You can expend one use of mythic power when you hit with both claws during the same round to rend with those claws, dealing extra damage equal to one claw\'s damage plus 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus.</p>\n<p><i>Mythic Leap (Ex)</i>: You can make a running jump without needing to run 10 feet beforehand. In addition, you gain a +5 bonus on your Acrobatics checks to determine the success of that jump and the distance covered. If you already have the predator\'s leap manifestation of Aspect of the Beast, the bonus on your Acrobatics checks increases to +10.</p>\n<p><i>Mythic Instinct (Ex)</i>: You gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks and a +2 bonus on Survival checks. These bonuses stack with those gained from the wild instinct manifestation of Aspect of the Beast.</p>\n<p>Athletic (Mythic)</p>\n<p>You excel far beyond others at acts of physical prowess.</p>\n<p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Athletic.</p>\n<p><b>Benefit</b>: The bonus on Climb and Swim skill checks from Athletic increases by 2. In addition, you can expend one use of mythic power to treat a Climb or Swim check as if you had rolled a natural 20. You must decide to use this ability before making the roll.</p>\n<p>Augment Summoning (Mythic)</p>\n<p>Your summoning spells bring not mere ordinary beasts, but instead mythic creatures.</p>\n<p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Augment Summoning.</p>\n<p><b>Benefit</b>: Any creature you summon using a summon spell is considered mythic for the purpose of interacting with other mythic creatures. It doesn\'t gain any mythic abilities or power, but is affected by mythic spells and abilities as if it were a 1st-tier mythic creature. Additionally, if the creature summoned has damage reduction, its damage reduction becomes DR/epic.<span></span></p>\n<p>Bleeding Critical (Mythic)</p>\n<p>Your deadliest blows unleash rivers of blood.</p>\n<p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Bleeding Critical, Critical Focus (mythic).</p>\n<p><b>Benefit</b>: The bleed damage dealt with Bleeding Critical increases by your tier.
